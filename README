To run jMax:
 
  1. copy all files of the jMax distribution (see above) to
     "/usr/local/max" (recommended) or a directory of your choice 
     we'll refer to as "<jMax root dir>" in the following

  2. copy the configuration file "<jMax root dir>/config/example.jmaxrc" to "~/.jmaxrc"

  3. edit the configuration file "~/.jmaxrc" so that ...
       ... the variable "jmaxArch" will be set to your platform string (see line 13 to 17)
       ... the variable "jmaxHost" will be set to the host name you want to run jMax on  (see line 19 to 21)

  4. in the case you installed jMax in "/usr/local/max" as recommended just run 

        <jMax root dir>/bin/jmax

     otherwise use the following command line (replace <jMax root dir>)
	
        "java -noasyncgc -mx64m -ms2m  -classpath .:/usr/java/lib/rt.jar:<jMax root dir>/java/classes/jmax.jar:<jMax root dir>/java/lib/jacl1.0/jacl.jar:<jMax root dir>/java/lib/swing-1.0.1/swingall.jar ircam.jmax.MaxApplication -root <jMax root dir>"
