<H2> Changed features </H2>

<UL>
<LI> the jmax ``-install'' option has been removed. The root directory (i.e.
the directory where jMax takes the Java classes, the server, the libraries, etc)
is given by the directory from which the script jmax is started. As a consequence,
to start:
<UL>
<LI> the standard installation (in /usr/local/max): start /usr/local/max/bin/jmax
<LI> the snapshot installation (usually in /usr/local/max-snapshot): 
start /usr/local/max-snapshot/bin/jmax
</UL>
</UL>

<H2> New features </H2>

<UL>
<LI> the system property "FastFileBox" is now exported as a Tcl variable, so that you
can set it in your .jmaxrc file:
<PRE>
set jmaxFastFileBox "true"
</PRE>
as well as by the command line:
<PRE>
jmax -jmaxFastFileBox
</PRE>
By default, this variable is set to "false".
<LI> 24 bits audio I/O
<LI> improved patch opening time up to 40 %
<LI> detection of ADAT input not connected. Instead of FTS being blocked, an error message 
"No Carrier On Audio Input" is issued.
</UL>
