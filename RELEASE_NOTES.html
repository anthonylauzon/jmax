<H2> Fixed bugs </H2>

The following bugs have been fixed:
<UL>
<LI> crashes when loading big patches and running high priority. In this case,
locking the memory (so that FTS is not swapped) caused a crash when physical
memory was exhausted. Fixed both in kernel setting for Octanes and in
FTS.
<LI> table: values for x > 127 were not displayed
<LI> #99: Objects sizes (partially: only for bang)
<LI> #112: exception when deleting an object
<LI> #113: Exceptions in copy/paste
</UL>
