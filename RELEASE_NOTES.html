<H2> New features </H2>

<UL>
<LI> jmax option -jmaxFastFileBox will get a faster FileBox, *but*
 there will be no filters and no icons. Thru the net, the difference is highly visible.<BR>
To use it, either add it to your alias (i.e. 
``alias jmaxs /usr/local/max-snapshot/bin/jmax -install snapshot -jmaxFastFileBox'')
or pass it as argument to the script jmax or to the alias.
</UL>

<H2> Known bugs </H2>

<UL>
<LI> 96: Connections, objects and user-interface objects precedence <BR>
Clicking on an object that overlaps another objects alters the objects precedence
in a strange way.
<LI> 105: Etirement des objets Interface Graphique <BR>
If a selection is present, resizing an object does not resize the selection,
but resizes only the selected object.
</UL>

<LI> 103: explode (It's not possible to copy cut and paste in explode window.)<BR>
