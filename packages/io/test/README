This directory contains test material for io package.

1) udp test

1.1) with the Java program

 - recompile the Java sources, in java/ subdirectory:
	make all (swingall.jar must be in CLASSPATH)
 - run jmax
 - load patch test-udp.jmax
 - run UDPTest.class
	java UDPTest <host name> <port>
		<host name> is the host name of the host running jMax
		<port> is the port number (specified as argument of the udp object)
 - this will open a Java application with a window containing a slider. Move the slider, 
   the slider in the jMax patch should move too... 

1.2) with the C program

 - recompile the C sources, in c/ subdirectory:
 - run jmax
 - load patch test-udp.jmax
 - run udptest
 	udptest <host name> <port>
		<host name> is the host name of the host running jMax
		<port> is the port number (specified as argument of the udp object)
 - this program reads number on standard input and send them to jMax. The slider
	in the patch should move to the number you typed...
 

2) udpmessage test

2.1) with the Java program

 - recompile the Java sources, in java/ subdirectory:
	make all (swingall.jar must be in CLASSPATH)
 - run jmax
 - load patch test-udpmessage.jmax
 - run UDPMessageTest.class
	make run MAIN=UDPMessageTest ARGS="<host name> <port> freq vol mod"
		<host name> is the host name of the host running jMax
		<port> is the port number (specified as argument of the udp object)
		remaining arguments are message names
 - this will open a Java application with a window containing a number of sliders. 
	Move the sliders, the corresponding sliders in the jMax patch should move too... 

2.2) with the C program

 - recompile the C sources, in c/ subdirectory:
 - run jmax
 - load patch test-udp.jmax
 - run udpmessagetest
 	udpmessagetest <host name> <port>
		<host name> is the host name of the host running jMax
		<port> is the port number (specified as argument of the udp object)
 - this program reads command lines on standard input. A command line is a string
	followed by a number (either int or float). The string and the number are 
	sent to jMax using the protocol. In the receiving patch, the string is used
	as a selector and the number is send to the corresponding slider.
