This directory contains test material for io package.

1) udp test

This test requires to recompile the Java sources.
  make all
(swingall.jar must be in CLASSPATH)

To test the udp object:
 - run jmax
 - load patch test-udp.jmax
 - run UDPTest.class
   java UDPTest <host name> <port>
     where <host name> is the host name of the host running jMax
           <port> is the port number (specified as argument of the udp object)
 - this will open a Java application with a window containing a slider. Move the slider, 
   the slider in the jMax patch should move too... 

2) udpmessage test

This test requires to recompile the Java sources.
  make all
(swingall.jar must be in CLASSPATH)

To test the udpmessage object:
 - run jmax
 - load patch test-udpmessage.jmax
 - run UDPMessageTest.class
   make run MAIN=UDPMessageTest ARGS="<host name> <port> freq vol mod"
     where <host name> is the host name of the host running jMax
           <port> is the port number (specified as argument of the udp object)
	   and remaining arguments are message names
 - this will open a Java application with a window containing a slider. Move the slider, 
   the slider in the jMax patch should move too...
