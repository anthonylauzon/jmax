	* Changed patcher.c: moving to save .pat files. This is not complete yet...

	* Changed patparser.c: removed the scaling that was applied when loading .pat files.

	* Changed protocol handling: runtime/client/incoming.c, runtime/client/outgoing.c
	  - the protocol is now binary in both directions.
	  - the symbols are cached in both directions.
	  - the code is cleaner
	  - some bug fixes (symbol cache miss resulted in an infinite loop...)

2000-03-22  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Changed symbols.[ch]:
	  - introduced predefsymbols.h in order to centralize predefined symbols definition
	  - added doc headers to symbols.h
	  - cleaned code in symbols.c

	* Changed outgoing.c:
	  - moved symbol cache handling there
	  - removed useless code
	  - fixed sending symbol as string (which happens when symbol cannot be cached)

2000-02-21  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Fixed "cannot kill fts without being super-user". This came from a bug in 
	non-portable/sgi/platform.c

	* Fixed wrong message "cannot lock memory".
