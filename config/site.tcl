#  jMax site configuration
#  
#  This file is executed at start up; you can add tcl code
#  here to simplify the user configuration in your site
#
#  For example, for each type of machines you can write a tcl
#  function that set the standard configuration for your site,
#  and your users can just execute this function in their .jmaxrc
#  
#  Like:
#
#  proc octaneStandardConfig {} {
# 	openDefaultMidi     SerialPort2
#	openDefaultAudioIn  ADATIn   8 
#	openDefaultAudioOut ADATOut  8     
#  }
