<h3>Features</h3>

<p>
The various Tcl <code>open</code> commands now accept arguments that
can be used to specify device parameters values. The affected commands are:
<ul>
<li> <code>openAudioIn</code>
<li> <code>openDefaultAudioIn</code>
<li> <code>openNamedDefaultAudioIn</code>
<li> <code>openAudioOut</code>
<li> <code>openDefaultAudioOut</code>
<li> <code>openNamedDefaultAudioOut</code>
<li> <code>openMidi</code>
<li> <code>openDefaultMidi</code>
</ul>

<p>
The parameters that are passed as the last argument (a list inside "")
are passed to the device <code>open</code> function. The arguments that
are accepted are device-dependent.

<p>
Example of use:
<pre>
openDefaultAudioIn stereoIn "device /dev/dsp8"
openDefaultAudioOut stereoOut "channels 8"
openDefaultMidi midi "device /dev/midi01"
openDefaultAudioOut prof_dac "profile_interval 1000"
</pre>


<p>
The Linux OSS MIDI device now accept a "mode" argument that is
passed to the <code>open()</code> system call in order to be able to
specify the file read/write mode of the device for device that
can be opened in only one direction. This argument can be passed
when opening the device with the <code>opendMidi</code> or
<code>openDefaultMidi</code> Tcl commands. This argument
can have the following value:
<ul>
<li> <code>r</code> for read-only
<li> <code>w</code> for write-only
<li> <code>rw</code> for read and write
</ul>

<p>
Example of use:
<pre>
openDefaultMidi midi "mode w"
</pre>

<a NAME="2.4.5">
 <h1> Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.4.5 </h1>
</a>

This release introduces significant changes in the FTS kernel, in the user
interface, in the development API and in the license...
<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is considered stable.
<h3>
Supported platforms</h3>
The following platforms are supported:
<ul>
<li>
Irix 6.3 for R5000 and R10000 processors</li>

<li>
Irix 6.5 for R4000, R5000 and R10000 processors</li>

<li>
Linux for Intel processors</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Fixed bugs</h3>
For a complete list of fixed and remaining bugs, please refer to the Ircam
bug tracking system, at the following URL:
<a href="http://www.ircam.fr/bugs/">http://www.ircam.fr/bugs/</a>
<p>Some older bugs have been replaced by newer ones, others have been kept.
<h3>
New features</h3>

<h4>
Patcher editor</h4>
The patch editor of version 2.4.x is a new implementation of the existing
patch editor. It introduces bug fixes, improvements in the user interface
(text handling, feedback, updates, ...) and new functionalities (icons
for objects or comments, ...).
<h4>
Multi-threaded kernel</h4>
The FTS server kernel is now multi-threaded. The kernel threads are for
now used only by the new implementation of the direct-to-disk objects.
Others uses are in development.
<h4>
Scheduler</h4>
The FTS server kernel incorporates a new scheduler that enables to add
and remove dynamically file descriptors in the scheduler's <tt>select()</tt>
system call. This is illustrated in the <i>udp</i> and <i>udpmessage</i>
objects that read bytes on a UDP port. See the sources of the object for
further explanations.
<h4>
Object development API</h4>
This release includes the object development API and documentation. Please
refer to the <i>Control Objects Developer's Guide</i> for documentation.
<p>A package named "sources" with objects source code is given as an example
and a starting point.
<h4>
Direct-to-disk objects</h4>
The first use of the multi-threaded kernel is a new implementation of the
direct-to-disk objects (<i>readsf~</i> and <i>writesf~</i>). These objects
are now implemented as wrappers of an FTS device that does the file access,
all the file I/O being done in separate threads. This implementation guarantees
that file accesses are non-blocking and that file reading/writing and samples
conversion is done on a separate processor when running on a multi-processor
machine.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> On the Linux platform, the direct-to-disk objects use the
<i>Audio
File Library</i>, by Michael Pruett. This library is available under the
GNU Library General Public License. This library must be installed before
using <i>readsf~</i> and
<i>writesf~</i> objects. Please refer to
<a href="http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/">http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/</a>
for information and download.

<h1>
Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.3.15</h1>

<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is considered:
<ul>
<li>
<b>stable</b> on SGI</li>

<li>
<b>beta</b> on Linux. Namely, the system has not been extensively tested
and its performance is not fully representative of the final performance
that can be achieved on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Supported platforms</h3>
This release have been compiled on:
<ul>
<li>
IRIX 6.5 for R10000, R5000, R4x00 processors</li>

<li>
IRIX 6.3 for R10000, R5000 processors</li>

<li>
Linux for Intel Pentium-Pro and Pentium-II processors. jMax uses glibc
and has been tested on Redhat 5.1 and 5.2.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Fixed bugs</h3>
The following bugs have been fixed:
<ul>
<li>
#154: systune maxlkmem must be checked</li>

<li>
#155: Pasting in a text field with already selected text</li>

<li>
(not reported): qlist jumps to top of text after paste</li>
</ul>
This release implements a workaround for the following bug:
<ul>
<li>
#139: printing in the console can freeze jmax.</li>

<br>By starting jMax either with the option "-jmaxNoConsole true" or by
adding the command "set jmaxNoConsole true" in your .jmaxrc file, console
printout will not show in the console window, but in the standard output
of the java process, usually a shell, and will not freeze java. A new console
graphic component will be implemented in a next release.</ul>

<h4>
Floating-point exceptions tracking</h4>
Support has been added to track floating-point exceptions. When floating-point
exceptions occur, you can open the "Fpe Panel" in "Tools" menu. This panel
will show the objects that triggered these exceptions (either in control
or in DSP computation). A supplementary option allows to track floating
point NaN (Not a Number) in DSP computation.
<br><b>Warning:</b> This option is very time-consuming and can dramatically
decrease performance.

<h1>
Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.3.12</h1>

<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is qualified as <tt>beta</tt>; the system is quite stable,
enough to be used in concert situation; the user interface still has some
glitches and instability anyway.
<h3>
Supported platform</h3>
This release have been compiled on:
<ul>
<li>
IRIX 6.5 for r10000 and r5000 processors.</li>

<li>
IRIX 6.3 for r5000 processors.</li>
</ul>
IRIX 6.2 will probably not be supported, as the AudioFile library on IRIX
6.2 lacks some features used by jMax. We suggest that you upgrade to IRIX
6.5.
<h4>
Changes in I/O configuration</h4>
The I/O configuration commands have been simplified a little; old .jmaxrc
files need to be changed; refer to the user configuration.
<h4>
Changes in CLASSPATH setting</h4>
Swing classes are now distributed with <i>j</i>Max. It is no longer required
to download Swing. Setting CLASSPATH is also no longer needed.
<h3>
Known Problems and bugs</h3>
Main problems regards the patch editor; in particular, overlapped objects
are not handled properly, and this produce bizarre situations when copy/pasting
in a crowded patch.
