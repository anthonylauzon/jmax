<h1>FTS 3+ message system</h1>
This paper develops features of a new FTS message system from a critical
analysis of the existing one.<br>
     
<h2>introduction of <i>data </i>objects</h2>
   The current message system doesn't distingush objects showing up as boxes
 on screen from others which are manipulated by the FTS message system.<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless more and more classes are created in FTS to represent complex
 data types such as vectors (e.g. fvec) or MIDI events. Instances of these
 <i><b>data classes</b></i> can be dynamically created as well as garbage
collected and sent in messages between the objects of a patcher.<br>
  <br>
  It has been experienced that manipulating objects this way the including
 use of side effects are significantly simplyfing FTS patches. On the other
 hand the manipulation of garbage objects has simplified the implementation
 of new FTS functionalities such as the MIDI system and the sequencer.<br>
   <br>
  The only way for patch programmer to invoke methods of an object is to
instantiate  it as a box in a patcher and send messages to an inlet. Another
way is to  send the object into an object instantiated in a patcher. Rather
generic <i><b> operator classe</b></i><i><b>s</b></i> such as <code>print
</code>and <code> getlist </code>are already implemented as method calls
to the received object. Other classes such <code>getelem</code> access directly
the objects data structure to produce an output but could be implemented
in a similar way.<br>
  <br>
   The  <i><b>data classes</b></i> of FTS include:<br>
      
<ul>
           
  <li>ivec</li>
           
  <li>fvec</li>
           
  <li>vec</li>
           
  <li>mat</li>
           
  <li>bpf</li>
           
  <li>messtab</li>
           
  <li>sequence and track<br>
       </li>
     
</ul>
   In addition references to objects (using variables) are used to handle 
objects of the following classes:<br>
      
<ul>
           
  <li>preset<br>
    </li>
       
  <li>bus and label</li>
       
  <li>bytestream<br>
    </li>
              
  <li>audioport and midiport</li>
     
</ul>
   A new message system should provide a more sophisticated garbage collector.<br>
  <br>
  A new implementation of the evaluator of textual expressions should give 
the possibility to create objects and invoke object's methods. The relationship 
 between textual expressions and such defined by a patcher is to be carefully
 defined.<br>
 <br>
   
<h2>messages, values and tuples</h2>
  In the current implementation of the message system doesn't distinguish 
messages and values send between the object of a patcher and as well on the 
user level both concept are confused:<br>
  In a message box "coucou", "coucou 1" "coucou 1 2 3" and represent messages,
 while "int 1", "1", "list 1 2 3" and "1 2 3" represent single values and 
lists of values. Single symbols can be expressed only as "symbol coucou".<br>
   Internaly values and lists of values send between objects are represented
 as messages with the primitive data type or class name as a selector. Method
 dispatching is applied only to the selector of a method.<br>
 <br>
  This creates the following inconveniences:<br>
 
<ul>
   
  <li>it must be taken care that an abitrary message can not be created with
 the name of a known data type as selector (for example "int coucou" must
be forbidden each time a messages is created)</li>
   
  <li>only a fixed set of data types can be used</li>
   
  <li>a method can be declared for a single data type only or type checking
 must be implementation in the method</li>
 
</ul>
  The term "list" is used for a data structure which is not implemented as
 a list (in the sense of dynamically linked lists, used for many other languages). 
This causes some confusion and will cause additional confusion, when "real" 
lists will be introduced at the user level of jMax.<br>
 <br>
 The term <i><b>tuple </b></i>should be given to the unmutable list of values 
(atoms) used for messages and functions with multiple arguments (currently 
array). The tuple term could - ones forever - replace list of the current 
MAX jargon (thanks to Python).<br>
 <br>
  The syntax of messages and tuples of values should be clearly distinguished.<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>properties</h2>
  Currently named properties of objects are used in the following situations:
 
<ul>
   
  <li>client/server communication</li>
   
  <li>object instantiation and initialization</li>
   
  <li>object persistency</li>
 
</ul>
   In all of this situations the mechnisms of setting properties and sending 
 messages are very similar. Most of the properties use deamons to access direcly
 the objects states via a "deamon"-function associated to the properties name.<br>
   The distinction of setting properties and sending messages is obsolete 
especially  when messages are implemented with a single argument (see below).<br>
 <br>
  It seems that there is no need for a plist for dynamic properties in each
 object. If ever a module of FTS has to dynamically associate a property
to  an object, the use of a object hash table inside the module is proposed
(no  persistency!).<br>
  &nbsp;<br>
 In order to completely replace object properties by methods a return value 
has to be introduced to FTS methods.<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>inlets and connections</h2>
For historical reasons messages with a selector (other than a data typesuch
as int, float, etc) are accepted only by the first inlet of an object. The
other inlets accept single values or MAX lists. The objects set of jMax still
respects this limitation.<br>
<br>
For jMax 3 it is proposed that messages - consisting of a selector and a
single value or tuple argument - are implemented for a given class independent
of the notion of inlets. FTS object apriori don't have inlets but only methods.
Instead of using a "system inlet" as in the current implementation, any (public??)
method of an object can be invoked at any time.<br>
It is proposed that inlets should be associated to messages (selectors) so
that sending a value or tuple to an inlet should have the same effect as
sending the message associated to the inlet with the given value or tuple
as argument to the object. Inlets could be even dynamically given to boxes
via the GUI.<br>
Messages to an object could be either accepted by the first inlet of a box
only, or by any of the inlets and redirected to the object. It has to be
veryfied how strictly FTS objects (current <i>data </i>objects) can be distingushed
from boxes (current <i>patcher </i>objects).<br>
<br>
It has to be veryfied how much the concept of boxes can be distingushed from
objects.<br>

<h2>methods</h2>
 A new implementation of the message system should provide method dispatching
 on argument types.<br>
   This can be significatly simplified by allowing only one argument for a
message. For functions or methods of multiple arguments the argument would
 be a tuple (object). In this case eventual type checking on multiple arguments
must be implemented inside the method (same for functions).<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>meta classes</h2>
<br>
<h2>inheritance and interfaces</h2>
<br>
 
<h2>expressions and functions</h2>
  The current main expression evaluator visible for the user is only applied
 to the creation of objects.<br>
  Further different evaluators/parsers are used for:<br>
   
<ul>
       
  <li>reading and writing atomfiles<br>
    </li>
       
  <li>the ISPW message box class</li>
       
  <li>the ISPW expr class</li>
   
</ul>
  In the creation of objects variables can be used ($name), which don't change
 their name in runtime. Changing the value of a variable causes the reinstantiation
 of all objects accessing this variable. It is desireable to provide <b><i>
  variables </i></b>in FTS, which can change their value at run-time and
which  can be distiguished from <i><b>constants</b></i> (the current variables).
 Non constant expressions could not be used in the instantiation of objects.<br>
  <br>
  A new implementation of the FTS expression parser/evaluator should provide
 a unified expression syntax including the following features:<br>
   
<ul>
       
  <li>evaluation of mathematical expressions</li>
       
  <li>access to distinguished constants and variables</li>
       
  <li>&lt;not finished&gt;<br>
    </li>
   
</ul>
  <br>
  &lt;yet unordered blabla:&gt;<br>
  A message box like object should allow to create objects and access to
the  state of objects such as in<br>
  "($0.size + $1[3].freq * $sr) * $2".<br>
  <br>
  &lt;yet unordered blabla:&gt;<br>
  FTS should provide a function abstraction so that functions - ones defined 
 (textualyl and/or graphically) - can be used by an operator object in a patcher
 with in and outlets as well as by textual expressions.<br>
