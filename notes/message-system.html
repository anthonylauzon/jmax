<h1>FTS 3+ message system</h1>
 This paper develops features of a new FTS message system from a critical 
analysis of the existing one.<br>
       
<h2>introduction of <i>data </i>objects</h2>
    The current message system doesn't distinguish objects showing up as
boxes  on screen from others which are manipulated by the FTS message system.<br>
   <br>
   Nevertheless more and more classes are created in FTS to represent complex 
 data types such as vectors (e.g. fvec) or MIDI events. Instances of these 
 <i><b>data classes</b></i> can be dynamically created as well as garbage 
collected and sent in messages between the objects of a patcher.<br>
   <br>
   It has been experienced that manipulating objects this way the including 
 use of side effects are significantly simplifying FTS patches. On the other 
 hand the manipulation of garbage objects has simplified the implementation 
 of new FTS functionalities such as the MIDI system and the sequencer.<br>
    <br>
   The only way for patch programmer to invoke methods of an object is to 
instantiate  it as a box in a patcher and send messages to an inlet. Another 
way is to  send the object into an object instantiated in a patcher. Rather 
generic <i><b> operator classe</b></i><i><b>s</b></i> such as <code>print 
</code>and <code> getlist </code>are already implemented as method calls to
the received object. Other classes such <code>getelem</code> access directly 
the objects data structure to produce an output but could be implemented in
a similar way.<br>
   <br>
    The  <i><b>data classes</b></i> of FTS include:<br>
        
<ul>
               
  <li>ivec</li>
               
  <li>fvec</li>
               
  <li>vec</li>
               
  <li>mat</li>
               
  <li>bpf</li>
               
  <li>messtab</li>
               
  <li>sequence and track<br>
        </li>
       
</ul>
    In addition references to objects (using variables) are used to handle
 objects of the following classes:<br>
        
<ul>
               
  <li>preset<br>
     </li>
           
  <li>bus and label</li>
           
  <li>bytestream<br>
     </li>
                  
  <li>audioport and midiport</li>
       
</ul>
    A new message system should provide a more sophisticated garbage collector.<br>
   <br>
   A new implementation of the evaluator of textual expressions should give
 the possibility to create objects and invoke object's methods. The relationship
  between textual expressions and such defined by a patcher is to be carefully 
 defined.<br>
  <br>
     
<h2>messages, values and tuples</h2>
   In the current implementation of the message system doesn't distinguish
 messages and values send between the object of a patcher and as well on
the  user level both concept are confused:<br>
   In a message box "coucou", "coucou 1" "coucou 1 2 3" and represent messages, 
 while "int 1", "1", "list 1 2 3" and "1 2 3" represent single values and
 lists of values. Single symbols can be expressed only as "symbol coucou".<br>
    Internally values and lists of values send between objects are represented 
 as messages with the primitive data type or class name as a selector. Method 
 dispatching is applied only to the selector of a method.<br>
  <br>
   This creates the following inconveniences:<br>
   
<ul>
       
  <li>it must be taken care that an arbitrary message can not be created with
 the name of a known data type as selector (for example "int coucou" must
be forbidden each time a messages is created)</li>
       
  <li>only a fixed set of data types can be used</li>
       
  <li>a method can be declared for a single data type only or type checking 
 must be implementation in the method</li>
   
</ul>
   The term "list" is used for a data structure which is not implemented
as  a list (in the sense of dynamically linked lists, used for many other
languages).  This causes some confusion and will cause additional confusion,
when "real"  lists will be introduced at the user level of jMax.<br>
  <br>
  The term <i><b>tuple </b></i>should be given to the unmutable list of values
 (atoms) used for messages and functions with multiple arguments (currently
 array). The tuple term could - ones forever - replace list of the current
 MAX jargon (thanks to Python).<br>
  <br>
   The syntax of messages and tuples of values should be clearly distinguished.<br>
  <br>
   
<h2>properties</h2>
   Currently named properties of objects are used in the following situations: 
  
<ul>
       
  <li>client/server communication</li>
       
  <li>object instantiation and initialization</li>
       
  <li>object persistency</li>
   
</ul>
    In all of this situations the mechanisms of setting properties and sending
  messages are very similar. Most of the properties use daemons to access 
directly  the objects states via a "daemon"-function associated to the properties
 name.<br>
    The distinction of setting properties and sending messages is obsolete
 especially  when messages are implemented with a single argument (see below).<br>
  <br>
   It seems that there is no need for a plist for dynamic properties in each 
 object. If ever a module of FTS has to dynamically associate a property to
 an object, the use of a object hash table inside the module is proposed (no
 persistency!).<br>
   &nbsp;<br>
  In order to completely replace object properties by methods a return value
 has to be introduced to FTS methods.<br>
  <br>
   
<h2>inlets</h2>
 For historical reasons messages with a selector (other than a data type
such as int, float, etc) are accepted only by the first inlet of an object.
The other inlets accept single values or MAX lists. The objects set of jMax
still respects this limitation.<br>
 <br>
 For jMax 3 it is proposed that messages - consisting of a selector and a 
single value or tuple argument - are implemented for a given class independent 
of the notion of inlets. FTS object apriori don't have inlets but only methods. 
Instead of using a "system inlet" as in the current implementation, any (public
??) method of an object can be invoked at any time.<br>
 <br>
 Inlets should be associated to messages (by a selector) so that sending
value to an inlet should have the same effect as invoking the message associated 
to the inlet with the given value as argument to the object (inlets could 
be even dynamically given to boxes via the GUI).<br>
 Messages to an object could be either accepted by the first inlet of a box 
only, or by any of the inlets and redirected to the object. It has to be verified
how strictly the concept of boxes (current <i>patcher </i>objects) can be
distinguished from basic FTS objects (current <i>data </i>objects).<br>
 <br>
Multiple inlets can be associated to the same method. In this case an index
should be available for the called method. This way meta classes are not
needed anymore for the implementation of classes with a variable number of
inlets.<br>
<br>
<h2>outlets</h2>
yy<br>
 
<h2>methods</h2>
  A new implementation of the message system should provide method dispatching 
 on argument types.<br>
    This can be significantly simplified by allowing only one argument for
 a message. For functions or methods of multiple arguments the argument would 
 be a tuple (object). In this case eventual type checking on multiple arguments 
must be implemented inside the method (same for functions).<br>
 <br>
 Methods have to be able to return values. Methods which doesn't return a 
value have to return a unique <i><b>void </b></i>value.<br>
 
<blockquote><code>fts_atom_t (*fts_method_t)(fts_object_t *o, fts_atom_t *arg)</code><br>
   </blockquote>
 A method is defined for a message (selector) and argument type (or meta
type ?? such as number, object, sequence, etc).<br>
   <br>
 Methods defined for different argument types can be used to set or get properties
of a given class. The concept of properties becomes obsolete this way.<br>
   <br>
   
  <h2>meta classes</h2>
   Meta classes are currently used in the following cases:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>classes with a variable number of inlets and/or outlets</li>
    <li>classes sharing the same semantic (such as <code>+</code> or <code>
play</code>) acting on different objects using different methods</li>
  </ul>
The first case is <br>
  <br>
   
  <h2>inheritance and interfaces</h2>
   <br>
     
  <h2>expressions and functions</h2>
   The current main expression evaluator visible for the user is only applied 
 to the creation of objects.<br>
   Further different evaluators/parsers are used for:<br>
       
  <ul>
             
    <li>reading and writing atomfiles<br>
     </li>
             
    <li>the ISPW message box class</li>
             
    <li>the ISPW expr class</li>
       
  </ul>
   In the creation of objects variables can be used ($name), which don't
change  their name in runtime. Changing the value of a variable causes the
reinstantiation  of all objects accessing this variable. It is desirable
to provide <b><i>   variables </i></b>in FTS, which can change their value
at run-time and which  can be distinguished from <i><b>constants</b></i>
(the current variables).  Non constant expressions could not be used in the
instantiation of objects.<br>
   <br>
   A new implementation of the FTS expression parser/evaluator should provide 
 a unified expression syntax including the following features:<br>
       
  <ul>
             
    <li>evaluation of mathematical expressions</li>
             
    <li>access to distinguished constants and variables</li>
             
    <li>&lt;not finished&gt;<br>
     </li>
       
  </ul>
   <br>
   &lt;yet unordered blabla:&gt;<br>
   A message box like object should allow to create objects and access to 
the  state of objects such as in<br>
   "($0.size + $1[3].freq * $sr) * $2".<br>
   <br>
   &lt;yet unordered blabla:&gt;<br>
   FTS should provide a function abstraction so that functions - ones defined
  (textually and/or graphically) - can be used by an operator object in a
patcher  with in and outlets as well as by textual expressions.<br>
  <br>
