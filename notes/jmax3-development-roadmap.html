<h1>jMax 3 development road map</h1>
  jMax 3 should be released as soon as possible. The developments mentioned
 in this paper are considered as urgent and have to be completed to be included
 to this release.<br>
 <br>
  The release of jMax 3 can be split into two steps: First a user release 
which provides the user with an interface (modules and syntax) introducing 
the dynamic client/server connection, a user friendly configuration and launcher
 applications embedded to the different platforms supported by the release:<br>
 
<ul>
   
  <li>Linux</li>
   
  <li>Windows</li>
   
  <li>MacOs X<br>
   </li>
   
  <li>SGI</li>
 
</ul>
  The implementation of a package for soundfile access on all four platforms
is to be considered as critical for this release.<br>
<br>
<h2>portable soundfile i/o</h2>
  The reading and writing of soundfiles must be handles by a platform dependent
 package and implemented for all  four platforms.<br>
<br>
 
<h2>dynamic client/server connection</h2>
  This is the most important group of new features for jMax 3:<br>
 
<ul>
   
  <li>the server can run without the client</li>
   
  <li>the client can be connected, deconnected and reconnected to the server
 at any moment</li>
   
  <li>multiple clients can be connected to the server</li>
 
</ul>
 
<h2><font>project, </font>package &amp; configuration</h2>
  A graphical editor should be provided for the editing of packages/projects.<br>
  How to handle the configuration???<br>
<br>
Default midiport and audioport becomes a configuration field instead of global
variable.<br>
<h2>variables and expression parsing</h2>
The current expression parsing and mechanism to resolve variable names are
major sources of instability and annoyance. jMax 3 should include a very
first version of a new parser providing  at least a very simple syntax for
messages close to the current jMax (MAX)  syntax for messages and simple
expressions. <br>
<ul>
  <li>parsing of strings to FTS' internal representations is done by the
server</li>
  <li>the client/server protocol permits to send parsed message and atoms 
 as well as unparsed strings<br>
  </li>
</ul>
  The parser has to be compatible with the future developments of jMax (implemented
 with a minimal effort!!). The parser should try to keep a maximum compatibility
 with MAX style messages and the expression syntax of jMax.<br>
<br>
  The parser should introduce the possibility to specify the package of class
 at the instantiation of an object. This way the transition towards a new
object set can be simplified.<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<h2>platform embedding</h2>
  At least for MacOsX and Windows version but as well for Linux a jMax launcher
 application should be provided, which fully integrates into the given OS
in a way that opening of jMax documents such as patches and projects can
be done in the standard way provided by a given OS (double-click, drag and
drop, etc.).<br>
 
<h2>parsing</h2>
<h2>message system</h2>
  For the first user release the changes of the message system should be
minimal.  Nevertheless some changes has to be done in order to support the
new parser  and client server communication. The outlines of the message
system for FTS  <br>
  after the jMax 3 user release should be developed in advance.<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>GUI features</h2>
  Editors should be provided for fvec, messtab (maybe to be renamed to "dictionary"
or so?),  and the MIDI track.<br>
 <br>
 
<h2>multi-thread</h2>
 
<p> Several threads running their own scheduler and communicating via message
 fifo (i.e. via control only)  </p>
 
<p> Do an async sound file reader (based on methods callback) and reimplement
 Direct-to-Disk  using async sound file reader.   </p>
