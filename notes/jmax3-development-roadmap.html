<h1>jMax 3 development roadmap</h1>

<p>
This development roadmap covers the upcoming jMax releases for major version number 3
(versions 3.1, 3.2 and following).

<p>
The releases of jMax 3 can be split into several steps:
<ul>
<li> a user release which provides the user with an interface (modules and syntax) introducing 
the dynamic client/server connection, a user friendly configuration and launcher
applications embedded to the different platforms supported by the release
<li> intermediate releases that completes theses releases with full functionnalities
on the different platforms (SGI, Linux, Windows, MacOS X)
<li> several developer releases that introduce changes in the message system API,
in the jMax file format...
</ul>
 
<p>
The currently planned releases are versions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Their respective 
contents are outlined below. The details of the release currently under development
are located in the TODO file.

<p>
It must be noted that version 3.0 is an intermediate step in the development and 
will exist only in the CVS numbering. In particular, its features are not complete
with respect to the configuration and the dynamic client/server connection.
Version 3.0 introduced the first version of the FTS <i>client library</i> which is
the base for developping client applications.


<h2>Content of release 3.1</h2>

<p>
This release can be considered as the first release that is "Tcl-free". It will
introduce several new features that have already been introduced partially in
version 3.0:
<ul>
<li> dynamic client/server connection
<li> project, package and configuration
<li> platform embedding
<li> changes in the object set
<li> changes in the FTS expressions parser
<li> portable soundfile I/O
</ul>

<p>
It must be noted that "Tcl-free" means that Tcl will no longer be necessary to run
the GUI, but that it can still be used as a scripting extension of the JAVA GUI, as
well as any other extension language (Scheme and Python are other candidates).

<p>
The planned release date for this version is 15 february 2002.


<h3>Dynamic client/server connection</h3>

<p>
This is the most important group of new features for jMax 3:
<ul>
  <li>the server can run without the client</li>
  <li>the client can be connected, deconnected and reconnected to the server at any moment</li>
  <li>multiple clients can be connected to the server</li>
</ul>

<p>
The implementation of this feature require major changes in the way of doing the server configuration.

<p>
The JAVA GUI will be modified in order to offer the same features as all the clients and the
communication layer between this GUI and the FTS server will be reimplemented using the FTS
client library.


<h3>Project, package and configuration</h3>

<p>
In jMax version 2.5, the configuration of the server (audio, MIDI, objet packages...) is done
by the JAVA client, using Tcl commands.

<p>
In jMax version 3.x, since the server can run without the client, this way of doing cannot be
maintained and the configuration must be done only on the server side. This has already been
partially implemented in version 3.0 in the form of "package" and "project" objects that
are saved in .jmax files.

<p>
A graphical editor will be provided for the editing of packages/projects. It will be
as generic as possible: package and project objects are, as any object, filled and saved as a list
of message, thus editing the content of these objects is editing a list of messages...

<p>
The question of how to handle the configuration is still opened (audio and MIDI ports
are objects, but the way of getting the defaults, the parameters, how to save
these settings is still not determined).


<H3>Platform embedding</h3>

<p>
A jMax launcher application will be provided, which fully integrates into the given platform
in a way that opening of jMax documents such as patches and projects can
be done in the standard way provided by the platform environment (double-click, drag and
drop, etc.).

<p>
This launcher application will be viewed in the platform environment as a standard application
that can be started from the toolbar menus, the desktop, etc.


<h3>Changes in the object set</h3>

<p>
To be written...


<h3>Changes in the FTS expression parser</h3>

<p>
The current expression parsing and mechanism to resolve variable names are
major sources of instability and annoyance. jMax 3 should include a very
first version of a new parser providing  at least a very simple syntax for
messages close to the current jMax (MAX) syntax for messages and simple
expressions. 

<p>
The parser has to be compatible with the future developments of jMax (implemented
with a minimal effort!!). The parser should try to keep a maximum compatibility
with MAX style messages and the expression syntax of jMax.

<p>
The current expression parser will be modified in order to introduce
a lexical analyser that is implemented on FTS side (it is currently
implemented on the JAVA side:
<ul>
  <li>parsing of strings to FTS' internal representations (atoms) is done by the
server</li>
  <li>the client/server protocol permits to send parsed message and atoms 
 as well as unparsed strings
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
This implementation will use Flex, a standard tool for generating lexical
analysers. It will be the base for future development of the expression parser
and of the underlying textual language for messages and objects instantiation.



<h3>Portable soundfile I/O</h3>

<p>
The implementation of a package for soundfile access on all four platforms
is to be considered as critical for the user release.

<p>
The reading and writing of soundfiles must be handles by a platform dependent
package and implemented for all four platforms using standard soundfiles libraries.

 
<h2>Content of version 3.2</h2>

<p>
This version will introduced 

<h3>variables and expression parsing</h3>


<p>
The parser should introduce the possibility to specify the package of class
at the instantiation of an object. This way the transition towards a new
object set can be simplified.

<p>
The parser should support also message invocation on objects and objects
instantiation.

 
<h3>message system</h3>
  For the first user release the changes of the message system should be
minimal.  Nevertheless some changes has to be done in order to support the
new parser  and client server communication. 

<p>
The outlines of the message
system for FTS after the jMax 3 user release should be developed in advance.
 
<h3>GUI features</h3>
  Editors should be provided for fvec, messtab (maybe to be renamed to "dictionary"
or so?),  and the MIDI track.

 
<h3>multi-thread</h3>
 
<p> Several threads running their own scheduler and communicating via message
 fifo (i.e. via control only)  </p>
 
<p> Do an async sound file reader (based on methods callback) and reimplement
 Direct-to-Disk  using async sound file reader.   </p>
