	* remove java test if jMax java compilation is disabled

2002-11-14  Patrice Tisserand  <Patrice.Tisserand@ircam.fr>

	* commited first version of Python FTS client client/python
	This is a port of C++ code into Python. It will need a refactoring to be more "python" and less "C++"

	* python client can send message to FTS

	* python client can receive message from FTS and correct handler is called (see client/python/testClient.py)
	
2002-11-13  Patrice Tisserand  <Patrice.Tisserand@ircam.fr>

	* Fix a race condition in FtsSocketConnection (cpp client)

	* client can receive message from FTS and correct handler is called (see test1.cpp)

	* added message handler management and receive thread to the C++ client library

	* cleaned the C++ version of the client library: removed FtsSymbol
	(now const char *), remove FtsServer (merged into FtsServerConnection).
	Client to FTS communication works. FTS to client not yet implemented.

2002-11-05  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* added the C++ version of the client library

2002-10-25  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	and the expression evaluator.

2002-10-10  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* implemented persistency (former keep property) for concerned objects (data, sequence, fts param, ...)
	* implemented named objects

2002-10-07  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* classes are objects
	* expressions can contain object expression (:class_name arg1 arg2 ...)
	at any level
	* hashtables key type is now a class

2002-10-06  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* reimplemented error objects as seperated class
	* reimplemented names and definitions (former variables) with hashtables in top level and template patcher 

2002-10-02  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* removed definitively metaclasses.
	* remove fts_object_new_to_patcher. Now, only 2 functions to create an object:
	fts_object_create and fts_eval_object_description

2002-10-02  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* removed properties related to the DSP subsystem
	* introduced fts_dsp_object_t as base structure for all DSP objects

	* adapted object set to DSP API changes

2002-09-30  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* changed bmax file magic number. It is now bMa2 (was bMax) and the 
	version number is passed to the loader. This is necessary for compatibility
	w.r.t. 2 things:
	 - the : is now part of the object description and is saved (it is skipped
	in the display of the object description)
	 - the variables that will be defined by a "define" object
	bMa2 files will not be loadable by jMax version 3.x or before. bMax files can
	be loaded inside jMax 4 and a compatibility layer handles conversion of the
	object description.

2002-09-26  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* reimplemented fts message system (API to be documented)...
	* adapted object set to new API

	* removed properties from real time updates (updates.c) 

2002-09-10  Patrice Tisserand  <Patrice.Tisserand@ircam.fr>

	* change package exported header file hierarchy. Now exported header file are located in 
	package_name/c/include and no more in package_name/c/src
	Exported header files are installed in:
	$(includedir)/fts/packages/package_name
	
	The following files were moved:
	   data/c/src/bpf.h    -> data/c/include/bpf.h
	   data/c/src/cvec.h   -> data/c/include/cvec.h
	   data/c/src/data.h   -> data/c/include/data.h

	   ispw/c/src/Makefile.am
	   numeric/c/src/Makefile.am
	   signal/c/src/Makefile.am
	   utils/c/src/Makefile.am
	  
2002-09-09  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* replaced remaining API elements that included capital letters (fts_Success -> fts_ok
	and fts_SystemInlet -> fts_system_inlet)

2002-09-09  Patrice Tisserand  <Patrice.Tisserand@ircam.fr>

	* fix code of dtdserver, now dtdserver constructor is called by fts_object_new_patcher 
	and not only by readsf_init. So now dtdserver destructor is called by fts_shutdown
	
2002-09-06  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* moved client/server protocol to "double" values. Changed the client Java API
	to addDouble, doubleValue & co.

	* fixed message box w.r.t. tuple and messages. To summarize, start 1 2 3 is
	a message and (start 1 2 3) is a tuple.

2002-07-25  Patrice Tisserand  <tisseran@lithium.ircam.fr>

	* first integration of ALSA sequencer objects.
	These objects will provide MIDI port connected with ALSA sequencer server,
	so these ports will be available for read/write to others ALSA sequencer clients.
	The following files were added:
	        packages/alsa/c/src/alsaseqmidi.h
		packages/alsa/c/src/alsaseqmidi.c
		packages/alsa/c/src/alsaseqmidiport.c
	
2002-07-24  Patrice Tisserand  <tisseran@lithium.ircam.fr>
	
	* clean documentation directory.

	(fts/patcher.c, fts/object.c) fts_expression to fts_oldexpression.
	* separated implementation of expression evaluator in fts/parser.c (the parser that
	creates the parse tree) and fts/expression.c (the evaluator that goes through the
	parse tree to evaluate it).

2002-07-17  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@limbe.ircam.fr>

	* removing old expression implementation and moving to the new
	parser/evaluator.
	First step is to remove all unnecessary inclusion of OLDexpression.h.
	This implied changing fts_run_mess_vm and was the occasion to merge all
	files dealing with file loading into one file per file format (.pat and .jmax)
	The following files were added:
		fts/bmaxfile.c
		fts/patfile.c
		include/ftsprivate/bmaxfile.h 
		include/ftsprivate/patfile.h 
	The following files were removed:
		fts/loader.c

	code in file.c. Changed objects w.r.t. this change.

	* hacked loading of patch files so that the search paths of the
	project contains the directory of the patch file.

2002-04-08  François Déchelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changed JMaxApplication so that it can guess its directory from the jmax.jar
	file.

	by configure+sed). Fixed wrong ENDIAN macro in utils.h

2002-03-12  François Déchelle  <dechelle@mac-dechelle.ircam.fr>

	* fts/audio.c: fixed code for installing default audio port class

2002-03-08  François Déchelle  <dechelle@mac-dechelle.ircam.fr>

	* fixed packages compilation problems on Mac OS X:
Problem on Mac OS X with shared libraries:
1) Apple has introduced starting at version 10.1 the "two-level namespace" that requires
that shared libraries and "bundles" (shared libraries that can be dlopened()) do not have 
unresolved symbols. This can be done by linking the bundle against the shared libraries
that defines these symbols and passing flag "-no-undefined" to libtool
2) libtool does not support correctly linking a shared library against other shared libraries
that are not installed. This is known in libtool terms as "inter-library dependencies" and is not 
supported by libtool until version 1.4

The first trial was to add all the dependencies on other shared libraries. This did not work because
of the libtool problem described above.

The second trial was to pass flag -flat_namespace to the linker (flat_namespace libraries can
have unresolved symbols). But libtool filters the options when linking (i.e. libtool --mode=link)
and the flag -flat_namespace was not passed to the linker.

The solution that seems to work is to add rules for colling explicitely the C compiler and to
install the .so library that was produced.


2002-03-05  François Déchelle  <dechelle@mac-dechelle.ircam.fr>

	* porting of version 3.1 to Mac OS X: fixed automake problems, compilation problems

	and FtsAtom

2002-02-08  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changed the atoms implementation. The tag was a symbol, it is now a hacked
	fts_metaclass_t * (hacked by the last bit that is set to one to identify 
	primitive types). 

	* changed the post implementation. post and other functions now print the
	characters on a byte stream. The clients can install their default console
	byte stream.

2002-01-22  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changing FTS code to remove symbol cache index from symbol structure
	and to remove also is_operator (replaced by a hash table). Removing fts_symbol_name().
	NOTE: this code does not work because of the use of some pointer bits in the type
	field of the atom. So, moving now to atom type as int.

2002-01-18  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changed client library to integrate symbol cache. Added FtsSymbol, splitted
	the code in different classes with cleaner interfaces.

2001-10-23  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Changed fts/client.c. The FTS object that is created by the client
	is now "client_controler", needs a symbol as argument (and thus no longer
	the "$" on the client side) and can be connected either to a bus or to 
	a label.

2001-10-22  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* bug fixed in class mat method function set_size
	* removed mess package (classes moved to package data)

	* Added --enable-electric-fence to configure

2001-10-15  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Changed kernel initialization: now splited into fts_kernel_*_init 
	(initialization of kernel structures) and fts_*_config (installation
	of kernel classes), so that the kernel objects can 1) access the
	command line arguments and 2) rely on the fact that the necessary
	platform initializations are done.

2001-09-28  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changed fts/saver.c in order to be able to open a .jmax file

	* changed fts_hashtable_t. Now, hashtable do rehashing, accepts any
	key type, use a good hash function for strings and can replace 1)
	the symbol table, 2) the object table. There is even a documentation
	of the API...

	* added fts_iterator_t, a generic iterator structure. It is implemented
	only for hashtables.

2001-07-13  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* added method for "incr" to intbox and floatbox

	* added tutorials to source tree

	* fixed audioport bug (null audioport was not instanciated, resulting in
	100% CPU)

2001-06-05  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fixed multichannel bug (all outlets of a dsp objects were allocated the
	same buffer. Came from a stupid bug in fts/src/lang/dsp/signal.c)

2001-05-30  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* moved all platform specific code to one file per platform (instead of

	port is defined by a variable (DefaultAudioPort). This way, the
	default audio port can be set from a patch (we are moving slowly
	to configuration done by patches). Also changed the nullaudioport
	mechanism (still a little bit ugly).

2001-04-10  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* finalized scope and vector display
	* moved scope and vector display to guiobj package

	* added null audio port, to prevent locking the machine.

2001-03-15  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Changed the audio I/O system
	Audio I/O no longer works with devices and logical devices, but
	uses a special object ("audioport") in fts/src/runtime/audio/audioport.c

2001-02-09  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Removed packages/alsa0.6dev and moved it to an external package

	* Changed header files structure:
          - fts header files are in include/fts
          - private header files remains in fts/src
          - packages now #include <fts/fts.h>
          - a package can be compiled either inside the jMax source tree
            or outside without changing the sources
          - header files tree is the same in the source tree and in the
            installation


2001-01-15  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Fixed error in fts/src/sys/Makefile

	* Fixed install errors in new Makefiles

2000-12-20  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	*  operation "Mani Pulite" on Makefiles is going on:
	  . all Makefiles for C part are now in jmax/Makefiles
	  . all platform dependent definitions are in jmax/Makefiles/Makefile.$(ARCH)
	  . you can do a 'make install' in the packages
	  . the packages Makefiles are much simpler (4 lines)
	  . the .so are build from the .o and not from the .a
	

2000-12-14  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* added packages/io/c/src/pipestream.c (a bytestream using a pipe). ***but*** it does 
	not work.

2000-12-13  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changed VERSION to 2.5.0, in order to be able to patch freely version 2.4.16

2000-12-11  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	*  lib/protocol: removed this directory and moved the files in 
	fts/src/runtime/client/protcodec.[ch] for the C part and to /dev/null
	for the Java part

2000-12-05  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* changed the makefiles for FTS: now only one library (libfts.a) is build
	instead of one library per directory. The Makefiles in fts/src/*/* are
	also much simpler.

	* added packages/audpdev

2000-12-04  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* added audpdev in ARCH_PACKAGES

2000-11-30  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* added ENABLE_ALSA in jmax.spec. By defining the environment variable ENABLE_ALSA=yes,
	the rpm will be compiled with ALSA (0.5.x yet)

2000-11-07  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* I think I've fixed the bug of dtd server going up to 99% CPU.
	(file descriptor 0 was set in the select() for dtd server)

	* added a hack in toplevel Makefile to allow to install a single package.
	The correct fix would be to include one single Makefile for the architecture.

2000-10-26  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* added compile hint ENABLE_ALSA0.6 to compile package alsa0.6dev

	* moved score following objects

2000-10-25  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	only with the Hammerfall card.

2000-09-28  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	*  package/unixdtd/src/*: changed a little bit the implementation of
	DTD. Now, a fifo is allocated for each readsf~ object.

2000-09-25  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fixed with Norbert remaining bug in DTD (strange pauses in readsf~)

2000-09-23  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fixed SGI multi-processor related issues: fts' options are
	passed to plaform_init(argc,argv), and option --cpu=N means that
	fts will run on processor N. If this option is absent, then it will
	run on first found isolated processor. This has been used because
	if you run 2 fts on the same machine, they would both choose the same
	processor to run on.

2000-09-19  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fts/src/runtime/sched/sched.[ch]: added fts_sched_add and fts_sched_remove
	to add and remove a free running method to the scheduler loop

2000-08-01  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* packages/explode/c/src/explode.c: added MIDI file export to explode object

2000-07-12  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* packages/midisgi/c/src/sgimidiport.c: fts_midiport_t implementation for SGI
	* packages/midi/*: added package midi (ISPW like midi objects based on fts_midiport_t)

2000-06-23  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fixed ambiguous class name FileFilter in java/src/ircam/jmax/dialogs/MaxFileChooser.java,
	because of conflicts with JDK 1.2

	* renamed Package.java to JMaxPackage.java, because of conflict with JDK 1.2 java.lang.Package

Fri Jun  9 15:35:11 2000  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@astor.ircam.fr>

	* fts/src/runtime/midi.h: added fts_midiport abstraction to midiport.*

2000-06-07  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* packages/io/c/src/iomodule.c: fixed missing call to serial_config()
	* packages/unixdtd: new (?) implementation of Direct-To-Disk objects, using
	a separate process (the thread implementation leaded to real-time problems
	on IRIX)
	* packages/unixdtd/src/readsf.c: readsf~ has an extra outlet that bangs when 
	file is finished.

2000-06-06  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* packages/ispw/src/data/table.c: fixed name table bug
	* packages/ispw/src/data/value.c: removed fts_..._named_object feature 
	* packages/ispw/src/sampling/sigtable.c: added messages read and write to system inlet
	* fts_named_object_send: now sending to system inlet

2000-05-26  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fts/src/runtime/sched/sched.c: fixed in fts_sched_do_select the first argument
	to select() (was n_fd, is now n_fd +1).

Mon May 22 11:57:20 2000  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@astor.ircam.fr>

	* fts/src/non-portable/sgi/syssched.c: 
	  added code for better use of multi-processor machines: if an isolated processor
	  is found, it is choosed by fts for running on it.

2000-05-15  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* added _FTS before #ifdef pp-commands in all header files

2000-05-09  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	See doc/running.html for further indications.

2000-04-28  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ligeti.ircam.fr>

	* fork object added in packages/guiobj java/.../patcher/objects java/.../fts
	* for object added in packages/control
	* range moved from packages/numeric to packages/control
	* vec object added in packages/data
	* eliminated MAXVS and MINVS in the kernel and packages
	* sched.h: added functions (makros)
	    fts_get_time_in_msecs()
	    fts_get_time_in_ticks()
	    fts_get_tick_size()
	    fts_get_tick_duration()
	* sched.h: added constants
	    FTS_MIN_TICK_SIZE
	    FTS_MAX_TICK_SIZE
	    FTS_DEF_TICK_SIZE

2000-04-27  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* Merged all ChangeLog files in subdirectories.

	* fts and java Makefiles: merged all install-noarch and install-arch targets

	* java: changed files names for too long names (MacOS porting)

2000-04-05  Norbert Schnell  <schnell@ircam.fr>

	* fts: runtime/files/midifile.[ch] Added midifile library based on the code by Tim Thompson

2000-03-31  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fts: sys/modules.[ch]: removed the restart function (which has never been tested nor used).
	Changed all modules accordingly.

2000-03-30  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* java: removed registration panel and the related code.

	* fts: runtime/sched/* and runtime/thread/*: removing the thread directory
	and integrating it in sched.c. Removed the fts_sched_declare stuff,
	that was uselessly complicated. Moving to the single select() scheduler.

2000-03-27  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* java: changed MaxFileChooser.java to find better the file format combo box.

	* fts: changed patcher.c: moving to save .pat files. This is not complete yet...

	* fts: changed patparser.c: removed the scaling that was applied when loading .pat files.

2000-03-23  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* java: fixed in FtsStream.java an incorrect parsing of SYMBOL_AND_DEF_CODE arguments.
	By the way, the parser in FtsStream.java is to be redone reusing incoming.c

	* java: fixed MaxFileChooser.java and PatcherSaveManager.java, going toward saving as .pat.
	Added the code that changes the file type combo box in order to use it
	for format selection. This has probably fixed the destiny of Mda (it will not resist
	to a client and a server not seeing same files at the same place).

	* java: changed protocol handling: FtsStream.java
	  - the protocol is now binary in both directions.
	  - the symbols are cached in both directions.
	  - the code is cleaner

	* fts: changed protocol handling: runtime/client/incoming.c, runtime/client/outgoing.c
	  - the protocol is now binary in both directions.
	  - the symbols are cached in both directions.
	  - the code is cleaner
	  - some bug fixes (symbol cache miss resulted in an infinite loop...)

2000-03-22  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fts: changed symbols.[ch]:
	  - introduced predefsymbols.h in order to centralize predefined symbols definition
	  - added doc headers to symbols.h
	  - cleaned code in symbols.c

	* fts: changed outgoing.c:
	  - moved symbol cache handling there
	  - removed useless code
	  - fixed sending symbol as string (which happens when symbol cannot be cached)

2000-03-16  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* java: ircam/fts: changed FtsDatagramStream, trying to fix the
	hostname and rsh problem. Just removed the code:
	    serverName = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();
	But it is probably not enough, and the server connection
	code must be redone.

2000-03-14  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* java: ircam/fts: added a default implementation of handleMessage
	in FtsObject that is based on Core Reflection API. Added a
	method getArgs() in FtsStream and a class FtsAtom.

2000-02-21  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* java: Makefile (jar): fixed missing silk in jar building

2000-02-21  Francois Dechelle  <dechelle@lipari.ircam.fr>

	* fts: fixed "cannot kill fts without being super-user". This came from a bug in 
	non-portable/sgi/platform.c

	* fts: fixed wrong message "cannot lock memory".
