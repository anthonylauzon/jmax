	* Fixed in FtsStream.java an incorrect parsing of SYMBOL_AND_DEF_CODE arguments.
	By the way, the parser in FtsStream.java is to be redone reusing incoming.c

	* Fixed MaxFileChooser.java and PatcherSaveManager.java, going toward saving as .pat.
	Added the code that changes the file type combo box in order to use it
	for format selection.
	
	Remark: we are getting closer, but this has fixed the destiny of Mda...

	* Changed protocol handling: FtsStream.java
	  - the protocol is now binary in both directions.
	  - the symbols are cached in both directions.
	  - the code is cleaner

	* ircam/fts: changed FtsDatagramStream, trying to fix the
	hostname and rsh problem. Just removed the code:
	    serverName = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName();
	But it is probably not enough, and the server connection
	code must be redone.

	* ircam/fts: added a default implementation of handleMessage
	in FtsObject that is based on Core Reflection API. Added a
	method getArgs() in FtsStream and a class FtsAtom.
