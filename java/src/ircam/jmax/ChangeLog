	* dialogs/StatisticsDialog.java: changed "freeMemory" to "UsedMemory".
	  Free memory doesn't really means a lot, after all.

	* Changed the way Ermes map the fts objects to the graphic representation.
	  The assumption that the Max names where uniques for the graphic representation
	  did not hold anymore with table, explode and qlist (all newobj, like
	  patcher).
	  Now Ermes have an explicit mapping of className to ErmesObject subclasses 
	  names, implemented using an hashtable.
	  The Graphic Representation do not hold the object name any more; an
	  alternative non default graphic representation will be specifiable
	  with FtsObject properties; same thing for the value stored in
	  the field ermesInfo, for which an explicit API will be provided.
	  As a consequence, new "i_*" names are not dropped.
	  The file format has changed accordingly, but will change again
	  during the week.
	  For the same reason, all the object names have been disambiguated
	  now, in FTS, slider and intbox are two different objects.
	  

	* Implemented parsers for table, qlist and explode in the
	  .pat files.

	* added a "requestFocus()" in ErmesSketchWindow, when "windowActivate".
	In the 1.1.3 JDK, the "gotFocus" and "lostFocus" are not sent 
	directly to the window when the mouse enters (or when the window is
	clicked, depending on the WManager configuration). A request is needed
	when the window is activated. This is likely to be a JDK bug.
	
	* did the same thing on the ProjectWindow

	* Added the "splash" tcl command, to pop up a splash screen;
	  any gif filename can be given as argument, the image will
	  be scaled; the jMax splash screen run from it, and user packages
	  can use it to have special additional splash screen.

	* Added the jMax package system, and converted the boot file to
	  use it; fts1.5 is a normal package now.

	* Added the "sourceFile" tcl command, that do not stop recursive
	  loading in case of errors like the built-in "source"; this allow
          finishing the boot process in case of errors in sub files.
	
	* Added tcl command openConsole, that create and install the system
	  console; the command will be executed by the installation configuration
	  script, so that a dedicated installation can work without the console;
	  note that if the console is not there, all the printouts go to the
	  standard output.

	* Changed the bootstrap tcl structure: there is only one boot file,
	  jmaxboot.tcl, stored in ~/projects/max/tcl, that actually include
	  the config/ermesrc.tcl and ~/.ermesrc file; see the comments in the
	  file for more information.
	  
	* MaxApplication.java: Changed PrintWriter back to PrintStream (also
	in all the code), in order to use the console as System.out; System.out
	has not yet been converted to printwriter in 1.1. !!
	The tcl
