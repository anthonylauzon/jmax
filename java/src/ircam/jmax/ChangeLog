	* Added the "splash" tcl command, to pop up a splash screen;
	  any gif filename can be given as argument, the image will
	  be scaled; the jMax splash screen run from it, and user packages
	  can use it to have special additional splash screen.

	* Added the jMax package system, and converted the boot file to
	  use it; fts1.5 is a normal package now.

	* Added the "sourceFile" tcl command, that do not stop recursive
	  loading in case of errors like the built-in "source"; this allow
          finishing the boot process in case of errors in sub files.
	
	* Added tcl command openConsole, that create and install the system
	  console; the command will be executed by the installation configuration
	  script, so that a dedicated installation can work without the console;
	  note that if the console is not there, all the printouts go to the
	  standard output.

	* Changed the bootstrap tcl structure: there is only one boot file,
	  jmaxboot.tcl, stored in ~/projects/max/tcl, that actually include
	  the config/ermesrc.tcl and ~/.ermesrc file; see the comments in the
	  file for more information.
	  
	* MaxApplication.java: Changed PrintWriter back to PrintStream (also
	in all the code), in order to use the console as System.out; System.out
	has not yet been converted to printwriter in 1.1. !!
