 This panel is automatically disabled and will not show 
 again next time you start jMax. If this does not happen,
 you can disable it by hand either by creating a file named
 .jmaxregistered in your home directory, start jMax with 
 the option '-jmaxNoRegister true' or put in your .jmaxrc 
 file the command 'set jmaxNoRegister true'.
