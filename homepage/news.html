Press Release
Friday September 25th, 1998

<P>
IRCAM announces first public release of jMax, a new generation of cross-platform software for music
performance and real time digital audio processing.

<P>
IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/ Musique) is a
non-profit organization associated with the Georges Pompidou National
Center of Art and Culture, Paris, France.

<P>
Since its foundation in 1969 by the French composer and conductor Pierre
Boulez, IRCAM has always been a pioneer in designing real time systems for
live interaction between instruments and computers.

<P>
The first generation of systems lead in 1981 to the 4X processor, designed
at IRCAM by the Italian engineer Giuseppe Di Giugno. The first compositions
using live interaction with a computer, including "Répons" from Pierre
Boulez, and "Jupiter"  from Philippe Manoury,  were done on the 4X. At the
beginning of the Apple Macintosh in the 80s, the US mathematician Miller
Puckette designed at IRCAM the Max software, that brought a new concept of
musical interface, providing a graphical language, based on patches of
elementary processing objects, for controlling real time processing
algorithms on the 4X. The Max software for the Macintosh was licensed to
Opcode Systems Inc.,CA, that adapted it and marketed it worldwide.

<P>
The next generation, the IRCAM Digital Signal Processing Workstation
(ISPW), was designed in 1991 at IRCAM by a team headed by Eric Lindemann.
The ISPW hardware was made of NeXT computers including up to 3 specific DSP
boards, each based on 2 Intel i860 processors, and marketed by Ariel Corp.,
NJ. The software included a new version of Max by Miller Puckette, used for
programming multiprocessor patches including both control and DSP
processing. The ISPWs have been used up to now by a considerable number of
composers as a basic real time programming environment for interactive
musical compositions.

<P>
jMax represents a new generation of real time systems at IRCAM that
consists of a fully cross-platform, hardware independent solution, based on
latest computer technology that offers backward compatibility to ISPW
patches, also known as "Max 0.26" patch format. It is currently being
developped by the Real Time Systems team at IRCAM lead by François Déchelle
with Maurizio de Cecco, Vincenzo Maggi and Norbert Schnell.

<P>
jMax is based on a client/server architecture, where the two main
components are the real-time engine, a fully ANSI C, new version of the
already known FTS server, and the Java graphical development and control
environment, including editors for patches, tables, note sequences, etc...
The client applications can live on the same computer as the server or on
any other computer running a Java virtual machine, connected to the server
through an Internet network connexion (using the UDP protocol on IP).
Multiple clients can connect to the same server for controlling the same
real time process, while having feedback on other clients' actions.

<P>
jMax is currently being developped on Silicon Graphics Inc. workstations
and the first release is on that platform. The SGI workstations offer
superior processing, real time performance, reliability and enable stereo
and multichannel digital audio I/O using existing or additional hardware in
a modular way. jMax will be available on Linux for Intel-compatible
processors by the end of 1998. Releases on other platforms are envisaged
for 1999, including Apple's MacOS X and Microsoft's Windows NT.

<P>
jMax is modular and configurable in many ways : users can design
graphically complex processing and synthesis patches from sets of objects
available in libraries; A C API is provided for programming objects that
are not available in the libraries; users can design their own Java
graphical interface by linking to a Java API that provides required
services for applications.

<P>
jMax comes with a rich set of patches and libraries for control and DSP
processing, that feature IRCAM's latest and cutting edge DSP technology,
including filters, pitch shifters and harmonizers, simple and interpolated
delays, short term Fourier transform and phase vocoder, pitch and score
following, formant analysis and synthesis, granular synthesis, additive
analysis and synthesis, modal synthesis, physical modeling synthesis, Spat
3D audio technology, etc... These libraries are continuously enhanced
through the latest research at IRCAM, patches used in new musical
compositions and by users outside of IRCAM.

<P>
<A NAME="demonstrations">jMax</A> will be demonstrated
 at the 105th Audio Engineering Society Convention
held in San Francisco, CA, from September 26 to 29, at SGI's room at Hotel
Milano (see <A HREF="http://www.aes.org/events/105/">http://www.aes.org/events/105/</A>),
and at the '98 International
Computer Music Conference, held at the University of Michigan, School of
Music, Ann Arbor, from October 1 to 6 
(see <A HREF="http://www.music.umich.edu/icmc98/index.html">
http://www.music.umich.edu/icmc98/index.html</A>).

<P>
jMax will be available for free download on IRCAM's ftp and http site
starting the beginning of November 98, with a basic set of DSP libraries
and documentation. A full-featured version, including more complete
documentation, support, tutorials and an extensive set of IRCAM librairies
and patches, is available through the registration, on a yearly basis, to
IRCAM's Forum (user group, see <A HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/activites/com-valo/valorisation/forum/accueilForum-e.html">http://www.ircam.fr/forum/</A>).
