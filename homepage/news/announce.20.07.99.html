<H1>Ircam releases jMax under GNU's General Public License</H1>

<P>
Paris, France (July 20, 1999) -- IRCAM announces the distribution of jMax,
its software environment for music performance and real time digital audio
processing, as free software under the GNU General Public License.

<p>
Since its first public release for the SGI and Linux platforms in early 
1999, jMax has reached several hundred users that expressed high interest 
in the product and its development. This interest, added to the rapid 
growth of the Linux operating system and the effectiveness of the open 
development model, created the conditions for an opening of the
jMax development.

<p>
By releasing jMax under GNU's General Public License, IRCAM brings a key
contribution to the computer music community and to the adoption of Linux 
for the multimedia market.

<p>
jMax is the new generation of real time systems at IRCAM, designed
to replace the Ircam Signal Processing Workstation. Based on a 
client/server architecture, wherein the two components are
the C written real-time engine already known as FTS 
and a Java graphical user interface, jMax features a high 
portability level.

<p>
jMax is currently supported on SGI workstations and on Linux for
Intel-compatible processors. Porting to other platforms are under
development, including Alpha-Linux, Linux-PPC, Solaris, Apple 
MacOS X and Microsoft's Windows. Compatibilities with Max/MSP 
(IRCAM/Opcode/Cycling'74) currently running on MacOS will be pursued.

<p>
Support, documentation, tutorials, CDROMs and musical applications for jMax
will be provided by the IRCAM Forum, the IRCAM user group accessible via a 
yearly subscription. IRCAM Forum can be reached at
<A HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/departements/valorisation/forum/index-e.html">
http://www.ircam.fr/departements/valorisation/forum/index-e.html</A>.

<p>
jMax is currently being developed at IRCAM by the Real Time Systems 
team, lead by François Déchelle, with Maurizio de Cecco, 
Enzo Maggi and Norbert Schnell.

<p>
jMax is currently used in concert and in studio, at Ircam and on international tours, 
for productions featuring real time audio synthesis and processing, as
well as for virtual reality interactive installations that combine image
and sound synthesis.

IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et de Coordination Acoustique/ Musique) is a
non-profit organization associated with the Georges Pompidou National
Center of Art and Culture, Paris, France. Since its foundation in 1969 
by the French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez, IRCAM has always 
been a pioneer in designing real time systems for live interaction 
between instruments and computers. The first generation of systems 
lead in 1981 to the 4X processor, designed at IRCAM by Giuseppe Di Giugno. 
In the 80s, Miller Puckette started developing at IRCAM the Max 
software, a visual language that brought a new concept in musical 
interaction. Max, licensed to Opcode Systems Inc., CA, has reached a 
wide audience in the computer music community. The IRCAM Signal Processing 
Workstation, designed in 1989 at IRCAM by a team leaded by Eric Lindemann, 
has been adopted by a large number of composers as a choice platform
for real time interactive musical pieces.
