<h2>General questions about <i>j</i>Max</h2>

  <a name="j_in_jmax">
  <dt><b>What does the <i>j</i> in <i>j</i>Max stand for?</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <i>j</i>Max is short for the complex term <b><i>Time + j Max</i></b>.<br>
    The imaginary part determined the name, while the real part defines the constrains...<br>
    (One could also think that it's because the user interface of <i>j</i>Max is
    entirely written in Java.)
  
  <p>
  <a name="what_is_fts">
  <dt><b>What is <i>FTS</i>?</b></dt>
  <dd>
    <i>FTS</i> was always the name of the server of the real-time project at IRCAM 
    and the former application developped here was refered to as <i>Max/FTS</i>.
    Since the server part of <i>j</i>Max is still <i>FTS</i>, and <i>FTS</i> is shorter to 
    spell than "the <i>j</i>Max server" we keep on saying <i>FTS</i> meaning the fast, 
    real-time, number crunshing, C written half of <i>j</i>Max.
