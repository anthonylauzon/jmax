<h1>Building a Mac OS X application for jMax using MRJAppBuilder</h1>


<h3>Preliminary</h3>

<p>
You must have installed jMax somewhere with a "make install".
The installation directory is set by the configure script, with
option --prefix, as in:
<pre>
./configure --prefix=$HOME/jmax-install
</pre>


<h3>Application building using MRJAppBuilder</h3>

<p>
Launch MRJAppBuilder.

<p>
In "Application" panel:
<ul>
<li>with button Choose, select the .jar file:
<pre>
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/share/jmax/java/jmax.jar
</pre>

<li> set the "Main classname"
<pre>
ircam.jmax.JMaxApplication
</pre>

<li> set the output file:
<pre>
jMax.app
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
In "MacOS X" panel:
<ul>
<li> set CFBundleName value:
<pre>
jMax
</pre>
<li> set CFBundleIconFile value:
<pre>
jmax.icns
</pre>
</ul>

<p align=center>

<p>
In "Java Properties" panel:
<ul>
<li> add the following property:
<pre>
com.apple.macos.useScreenMenuBar true
</pre>
</ul>

<p align=center>
<img src="images/JavaProperties-panel.jpg">


<p>
In "Merge Files" panel:
<ul>
<li>add
<pre>
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/share/jmax/client/java/ftsclient.jar
</pre>
<li>add
<pre>
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/share/jmax/images/jmax.icns
</pre>
</ul>

<p align=center>
<img src="images/MergeFiles-panel.jpg">


<p>
then click on "Build Application" button. The application should build
into the directory that you have set in "Application" panel.


<h3>Post MRJAppBuilder stuff</h3>

<p>
After generating the application, you must copy by hand the following 
directories and files:
<pre>
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/bin
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/lib
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/share/jmax/images
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/share/jmax/packages
&lt;installation-directory&gt;/share/jmax/config.jmax
</pre>
to the subdirectory
<pre>
jMax.app/Contents/Resources
</pre>
located under the "output file" that you have set when building the application.

<p>
This can be done using script post-mrjappbuilder, located in subdirectory bin under
jMax source directory (as long as you use the same directories):
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
if [ ! -d $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/jmax ] ; then mkdir $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/jmaxRoot ; fi
cp -r $HOME/projects/jmax-install/bin $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/bin
cp -r $HOME/projects/jmax-install/lib $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/lib
cp -r $HOME/projects/jmax-install/share/jmax/images $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/share/jmax/images
cp -r $HOME/projects/jmax-install/share/jmax/packages $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/share/jmax/packages
cp -r $HOME/projects/jmax-install/share/jmax/config.jmax $HOME/jMax.app/Contents/Resources/share/jmax/config.jmax
</pre>

<p>
It looks like there is a bug in MRJAppBuilder that makes that the 
generated application uses the default icon. This is solved by
copying the icon file jMax.app/Contents/Resources/Java/jmax.icns
to the directory jMax.app/Contents/Resources overwriting the
file that is generated by MRJAppBuilder. This is taken into account
by the script post-mrjappbuilder.
