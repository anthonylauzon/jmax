<A NAME="jmaxvsmax">
<H2><I>j</I>Max is not Max</H2>

<P>
<I>j</I>Max is based on the same programming paradigm as the other
members of the Max family, but it go a little bit further, and
introduce a first set of language extensions to augment its expressive
power, and to finally simplify the life of patch programmers, by
giving better ways to customize and parametrize patches and patch
libraries, and to refer data from objects.

<P>

This first release of <I>j</I>Max introduce the set of basic mechanisms;
these mechanisms will be used as the fundation for a new object library,
and will be extended in future releases.

<P>

<A NAME="variables">
<H2>Variables</H2>
<P>
A variable is a name associated to a value; the association between a value
and a name is made by instantiating an object, so the value of a variable
do not change during the execution, but only as the result of an editing
operation.
<P>

In order to be able to define a variable, an object need to export a
value, of any supported type; in general, not all the objects need or
should export a value, but only those objects representing some data
that need to be shared between objects; any objects can export data by
using a very simple API (not documented in this release); currently,
only the object "const", an object without inlets and outlets, export
a value, that correspond to its first argument.

<P>

A variable can be declared by prepending the variable name followed
by a semicolon to the object description, like in "sr : const 44100".

<P>
A variable value can be used in the instantiation of an object; an
argument in the form "$variable-name" is substituted with the
variable value <STRONG>before</STRONG> the object is instantiated;
since the variable substitution is handled by the system, the object
code don't need to know about variables, and all the object can be used
with variables.
<P>

<I>j</I>Max use local scoping for variables; this means that a variable
defined in a patcher will be visible in all its subpatchers, but it
will not be visible outside the patcher of definition; this avoid
conflicts and errors in reusing variables names and simplify writing
reusable patches; variables will be the preferred way to handle reference
to any kind of data in the future (like table and table~ objects), so that
locality of scoping will be available to all the form of data referencing.
In a future version, local variables will be accessible from the outside of
a patch by using a composite variable name (like "$spat.input.level").
<P>

The system keep track of all the dependencies between variables, and automatically
update all the depending objects when a variable change value as an effect of an editing
operations; since variables can depend on variables, the dependency handling is recursive;
all the unresolved dependencies handled as instantiation errors
(<I>red objects</I>); the resolving of pending dependencies cause automatic
object reinstantiation.
<P>

A variable can also contains an array of values; an array can for example
be defined by the object "srs: const { 32000, 44100, 48000 }", and accessed
with the standard syntax "$srs[1]" (see     <A HREF="#expressions"> Expressions </A>
below).

<P>
<A NAME="expressions">
<H2>Expressions</H2>

As we saw in the previous paragraph, we can use a variable in instantiating
an object, by putting a "$" followed by the variable name in the object arguments.
The dollar sign is an evaluation operator, that applied to a name return the value
of the corresponding variable; the sequence "$"/variable name is a very simple expression.
<P>
<I>j</I>Max actually support more complex expression; an object argument can be
defined as the result of an arbitrary complex expression; the expression syntax
is derived from the <B>C</B> programming language expressions, and include parentesys,
all the arithmetic, logic, bit-by-bit operators, the conditional operators, array access
and function calls, and the variable evalution operator ("$").
<P>
Also the object class can be defined by an expression. 
Functions calls are calls to a set of predefined functions; this release define a single
function, <code>unique()</code> that return a unique number each time is evaluated;
future releases will include a complete function library, and the possibility to define
functions thru a <B>C</B> API.

<P>
<A NAME="example">
<H2>An Example</H2>

Here is an example; have fun.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="patchers">
<H2>Patchers and Variables</H2>
<P>
<I>j</I>Max support another way to define variables; any patcher implicitly define
a variable, called "args", whose value is an array with all the patcher argument,
including its name; this may sound similar to the mechanism used to pass arguments
in abstraction in other Max.
<P>
Actually, this <strong>is</strong> the mechanism that is used
to pass arguments in <I>j</I>Max; the difference is that an argument can be passed not
only in abstractions, that in <I>j</I>Max are called <i>templates</i>, but in every
patcher; also, a patcher can pass named argument, i.e. define new variables explicitly,
adding at the end of the arguments a list of assignement in the form <code>variable = value</code>.


<P>

<A NAME="templates">
<H2>Templates</H2>
<P>
A template is the <I>j</I>Max version of other Max abstraction; we use
a different name mostly to avoid confusion, since <I>j</I>Max is able
to load and use also the older Max 0.26 abstractions.
<P>
A template is the implementation of a new object in the <I>j</I>Max language
itself; 

     subpatchers and templates


        + unification of subpatcher and abstraction mechanisms
          (programming by example)

        + arguments define (local) variables

        + positional and named arguments
            subpatcher: "pho one 2.0 3 coucou = 42" --> local
          variables: $args[], $coucou
