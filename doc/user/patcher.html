<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>jMax vs.Max </H1>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>A little introduction to the jMax patcher editor for Max
users </H2>

<H3>First: jMax is not Max. </H3>

<P>The two environments share a common metaphore, part of the graphic appearence,
and of course the same origin in the IRCAM's laboratories. But the common
elements are often &quot;false friends&quot; for who starts using jMax
after having used one of the Max flavours before (OpCode Max, Max-MSP,
or Max-FTS for ISPW or SGI). This little guide will present the main differences
between the jMax patcher editor and the other environments, from an user
interface point of view.</P>

<H3>1. Editing operations</H3>

<P>The main editor in jMax have a look and feel close to the other versions:
the use of colors is mainly intended to differentiate &quot;control objects&quot;
(blue) from &quot;language objects&quot; (green). </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Adding objects</B>: Every icon in the toolbar, except the first,
represent a class of objects that can be added in a patcher. Clicking on
an icon selects the corrisponding object, a subsequent click in the window
area (the &quot;sketchpad&quot;) adds it. The first icon is the lock/edit
mode button (see <A HREF="#Edit mode and Lock mode">paragraph 2</A> in
this document). What's different in jMax is that there's no need to drag
the object in order to add it. A double click on a icon of the toolbar
&quot;locks&quot; the simbol, so one can add multiple instances without
reselect. Another click in the toolbar deselect the locked one, as well
as a click on an object and/or connection in the sketch.</LI>

<LI><B>New &quot;subpatcher&quot; objects</B>: An important difference
in the object's set of jMax is the presence of a subpatcher object, the
fourth symbol in the toolbar from the left (the third after the hand).
This object is a local sub patcher, i.e. a subpatcher that does not reside
on a file, but is saved within the &quot;father&quot; patcher. From the
sketchpad operation point of view, the subpatcher is a normal editable
object. For the new user interactions related to the inlet/outlet please
see <A HREF="#Subpatcher inlet and outlets">paragraph 3</A> later in this
document.</LI>

<LI><B>Editing text inside objects</B>: the procedure of edit the &quot;editable
objects&quot; (external, message, subpatcher, comment) is a little different
from the other environment: The object must be selected, and then a click
on it will open its edit field (warn: not a double click). Writing in an
editable object dinamically enlarge it to contain the text.</LI>

<LI><B>Resizing</B> can be started from the right or bottom side of the
object, and is always constrained: horizontal only for the editable objects
and the number/float boxes, both direction togheter for the &quot;squared&quot;
objects like bang, toggle, inlet and outlet (they always stay squared)
horizontal OR vertical for the slider, depending on the point of drag.</LI>

<LI><B>Connecting </B>two objects: after a mouse down on an outlet, drag
the mouse until an inlet and release it. Note that the mouse changes its
shape when moved over a starting outlet or (dragged over) a destination
inlet, and that the sensible area where to start (or end) a connection
is always inside the objects itself, spanning over a greater surface.</LI>

<LI><B>Selecting</B>: since the editing of the text inside an object is
a two-step process, jMax can disambiguate between the selection of a single
object (<I>mouse down</I> on an unselected object) and the edit (<I>mouse
click</I> on an already selected object). The mouse operations with the
SHIFT key pressed are always related to the extension/reduction of the
current selection: SHIFT-mouse down on an already selected object deselects
it. If the object was deselected, its will be selected.</LI>

<LI><B>Moving</B>: the usual click-and-drag behaviour is implemented in
jMax</LI>

<LI><B>Clipboard</B>: The position of the pasted object(s) is always offsetted
of 20 points down and right from the original copied object(s). The usual
keyboard shortcut are implemented (CTRL-C CTRL-X CTRL-V).</LI>

<LI><B>Arrows</B> shortcuts: A number of geometric operation on objects
are possible with the arrows on a (group of) selected objects:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>arrow move the object one pixel in the given direction </LI>

<LI>SHIFT-arrow move the object faster </LI>

<LI>CTRL-arrow resize the object in the given direction </LI>

<LI>SHIFT-CTRL-arrow resize the object faster </LI>

<LI>ALT-arrow aligns the group of objects to the right, left, up or bottom</LI>

<LI>ALT-CTRL-arrow right resize all the selected objects to the maximum
horizontal size in the selection.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>Note that every operation including mouse drags (area selecting, resizing,
connecting, moving) can extend over the limit of the visible sketch. The
sketch will scroll accordingly.</P>

<H3>2. <A NAME="Edit mode and Lock mode"></A>Edit mode and Lock mode </H3>

<P>The mouse operation are interpreted differently according to the state
of the sketch. The state is controlled by the little hand in the toolbar:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>closed hand = lock mode</LI>

<LI>open hand = edit mode. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The color of the background (gray/white) reflect the current state (edit/lock).
In lock mode, clicks on user objects like sliders, numbers, bangs and toggles
are interpreted as commands to send to the underlying controller. </P>

<P>In edit mode, the same mouse operations are interpreted as select, resize,
move, edit the object itself. Some object are not controllable in lock
mode: their color is usually green. Note that in edit mode one can access
the &quot;run time&quot; behaviour of an object by clicking on it with
the CTRL key pressed.</P>

<P>Double-click on an object generally means &quot;open&quot;; subpatcher
or templates, in both lock and edit mode, opens the corresponding subpatcher.
External objects that have an associated editor invoke their editor (is
the case of qlist, table, explode).</P>

<H3>3. <A NAME="Subpatcher inlet and outlets"></A>Subpatcher inlet and
outlets</H3>

<P>The inlets and outlets of a subpatcher and templates are treated quite
differently in jMax. For clarity, let's call the inlet/outlet presented
on the border of the subpatcher object <I>outer</I> inlet/outlet, and the
inlet/outlet <I>objects</I> placed inside such a subpatcher <I>inner</I>
inlet/outlet.</P>

<P>In jMax the <I>outer</I> inlet/outlets are considered as numbered from
the left (starting from zero), and each <I>inner</I> inlet/outlet have
a number, that represents its association with one of the <I>outer</I>
inlet/outlet, without regard of the position they occupy in the sketch.
So, an <I>inner</I> inlet/outlet is just a placeholder for one of the <I>outer</I>
inlet/outlet. Once instantiated, an inner inlet/outlet can be re-assigned
to correspond to a different outer inlet/outlet, as we will see later in
this paragraph.</P>

<P>The rule is the following: <I>The number of outer inlets always corresponds
to the last number represented by a subpatcher inlets (plus one). </I>If
the last number represented by an inner inlet is 10, the subpatcher object
will have 11 outer inlets. As an consequence of this, a subpatcher containing
just one inlet whose number is 10, will anyway have 11 outer inlets.</P>

<P>In general, there can be less <I>inner</I> inlet/outlet then <I>outer</I>
ones, and more then one inner inlet/outlet can have the same number. All
the inlets with the same number will receive the same message. If no inner
inlet is associated with a given number, the corresponding outer inlet
is not connected to any object inside the subpatcher. </P>

<P>Adding, removing and reassign an inlet/outlet is done in the subpatcher
window: the subpatcher object will stay consistent with ts content, and
will show the right number of outer inlet/outlet. </P>

<P>Let's see some example of interactions:</P>

<UL>
<LI>An inlet added in an empty subpatcher will have the &quot;0&quot; number,
and an outer inlet will appear in the subpatcher object. Adding other inner
inlets will result in progressively numbered inlet objects, and in successive
outer inlets added on the subpatcher object.</LI>

<LI>Deleting an inner inlet will change the number of outer inlets only
if the deleted inlet was the last one. In this case, the number of outer
inlets will be reduced according to the rule given before. Of course, deleting
all the inner inlet will result in deleting all the outer inlets.</LI>

<LI>An inner inlet can be renumbered by double-click on it and dragging
the popup menu that appears; this popup contains the list of available
<I>outer</I> inlets, plus a number of extra inlets that can be added.</LI>

<LI>When there are available (not assigned) outer inlets, a newly added
inner inlet will have the number of the first available outer one. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The inner inlets/outlets can be freely moved around, since their corrispondence
with the outer inlet/outlet is given by their number, and not by their
geometric position. This is a major departure from the other Max environments.</P>
