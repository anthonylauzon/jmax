<HR>

<P>
As <I>j</I>Max and other Max environments share a common paradigm,
part of the graphic appearence is the same, and using <I>j</I>Max
patch editor will be easy for a user that already has experience
with another version of Max. This document will then concentrate on the main differences
between the jMax patcher editor and the other environments, from an user
interface point of view.


<A NAME="toolbar"><H2>Toolbar</H2></A>

<P>
Every button in the toolbar, except the first, represent a class of objects that can be added in a patcher. 
The first button is the lock/edit mode button, that represent the current mode of interaction
with the patcher.


<A NAME="adding object"><H2>Adding object</H2></A>

<P>
Adding an object is done by clicking on a toolbar button: this selects the corresponding 
object for insertion in the patch. A subsequent click in the patch area adds it. 
A difference with Max/ISPW is that there is no need to drag the object from the palette.

<P>
A double click on a button of the toolbar
&quot;locks&quot; it, so multiple instances can be added without
reselecting. Another click in the toolbar deselect the locked one, as well
as a click on an object and/or connection in the patch.

<P>
The subpatcher object is associated with a separate toolbar button 
<IMG SRC="../images/tool_patcher.gif" BORDER=2 ALIGN=TOP>. The subpatcher object
is a normal editable object.


<A NAME="editing object"><H2>Editing object</H2></A>

<P>
Editing text inside objects is done by first selecting the object, then
clicking on it (<I>Warning</I>: not a double click). This opens a text edit field that will be 
dynamically enlarged to contain the text.



<A NAME="opening an editor"><H2>Opening an editor</H2></A>

<P>
Opening the editor associated to an object is done by double-clicking on the object.
The object class determines what editor will be loaded (i.e. the patcher editor
for a patcher or a template instance, the table editor for a table, the explode
editor for an explode, etc.)


<A NAME="resizing object"><H2>Resizing object</H2></A>

<P>
Resizing can be started from the right or bottom side of the
object by dragging from the resize sensibility area (cursor is changed to
resize cursor when mouse is in this area). Resizing is always constrained: horizontal only for text objects
and number/float boxes; both direction together for the &quot;squared&quot;
objects like bang, toggle, inlet and outlet; 
horizontal OR vertical for the slider, depending on the chosen area.</LI>


<A NAME="connecting objects"><H2>Connecting objects</H2></A>

<P>
Connecting two objects is done by clicking on an outlet, then dragging
to an inlet and releasing it. Note that the mouse changes its
shape when moved over a starting outlet or (dragged over) a destination
inlet, and that the sensible area where to start (or end) a connection
is always inside the objects itself, spanning over a greater surface.</LI>


<A NAME="selecting object"><H2>Selecting object</H2></A>

<P>
Clicking on an object selects it. Selection
can be extended or reduced by SHIFT modifier: SHIFT-click on an already selected object deselects
it, on a non selected object selects it and add it to the selection.

<P>
Area selection is obtained by mouse drag outside objects.


<A NAME="moving object"><H2>Moving object</H2></A>

<P>
Moving a selection is obtained with the usual click-and-drag behaviour


<A NAME="copy/cut/pasting objects"><H2>Copy/cut/pasting objects</H2></A>

<P>
Copy/cut/paste is obtained either via the "Edit" menu, or via menu shortcuts.
The position of the pasted object(s) is always offsetted down and right from the 
original copied object(s).


<A NAME="using key bindings"><H2>Using key bindings</H2></A>

<P>
The following key bindings are currently available:

<A NAME="edit/lock mode"><H2>Edit/lock mode</H2></A>

<P>
Switching from edit mode (where objects can be added, deleted, edited, connected, ...)
and lock mode (where only graphical controlers are active) is done by:
<UL>
<LI> clicking on the leftmost button of the palette (closed hand = lock mode,
open hand = edit mode
<LI> typing CTRL-e
</UL>

<P>
The current state is reflected by the palette and by the color of the background (gray/white).

<P>
A graphical controler (slider, number box, button, etc) can be actionned
in edit mode by clicking on it with the CTRL key pressed.



<A NAME="changing patcher in/outlets"><H2>Changing patcher in/outlets</H2></A>

<P>
The inlets/outlets of a patcher are numbered, starting from 0. The main
difference introduced by <I>j</I>Max is that the index of an inlet/outlet 
is a characteristic of this object and is <I>NOT</I>
a function of the inlet/outlet geometric position in the patch.
The inlet/outlet index is visible inside the inlet/outlet object.

<P>
When an inlet (resp. outlet) is added to a patcher, it is given an index
equals to the current number of inlets (resp. outlets) of the patcher
plus one.

<P>
The inlet/outlet index can be changed
via a pop-up menu obtained by double-clicking and dragging (argh...)
on the object.

<P>
A patcher may contain several inlets/outlets having same number. In this case,
they are considered (from the connected objects point of view) as being one
single inlet/outlet.
