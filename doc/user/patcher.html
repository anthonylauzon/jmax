<h2>
The Toolbar</h2>
The toolbar of the patcher window gives control over the basic mode and
edit functions of the patcher window.
<p>The <i>j</i>Max patcher window is at the same time the graphical patch
editor and an interface for controlling a programm (patch) using some graphical
controllers like sliders. It distigushes modes <b><i>edit</i></b> and <b><i>lock</i></b>.
<p>In <b>lock mode</b> the toolbar shows only the button to toggle between
the modes&nbsp;<img SRC="tool_lock_mode.gif" BORDER=0 > (indicating the
lock mode). In this state the patcher can not be edited and the graphic
display is optimized for real-time performance.
<center>
<p><img SRC="toolbar_lock.gif" BORDER=0 ></center>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>
<p>In <b>edit mode&nbsp;<img SRC="tool_edit_mode.gif" BORDER=0 ></b> the
palette of the jMax objects appears in the toolbar and the patcher can
be edited.
<center>
<p><img SRC="toolbar_edit.gif" BORDER=0 ></center>

<p><br>
<p>The key short-cut <b>control-e </b>can be used to toggle between edit
and lock mode.
<p>In the case that the content of a patcher was changed the <b>save button&nbsp;<img SRC="to_save.gif" BORDER=0 ></b>
appears on the right of the toolbar. It vanishes when the patcher is saved
(via the Files menu of by clicking the save button).
<p>Patcher inside a patcher (sub-patchers) have an additional button on
the right of the toolbar:&nbsp;<img SRC="tool_up.gif" BORDER=0 >. This
button allows to focus the window of the <b>parent patcher</b> of the current
patcher. The patcher object associated of the current patcher will appear
selected inside of its parent patcher window.
<p><a NAME="objects"></a>

<h2>
Manipulating Objects</h2>
For <b>adding</b> an object to patcher in edit mode one selects an object
in toolbar and clicks to the position inside the patcher window where the
object will be instantiated. By holding the shift-key multiple instances
of the same object can be created one after the other. The content of the
toolbar is as well accessible via a contextual pop-up menu (click right
mouse button) inside the patcher window:

<p>(Refer to help patches for further information about the objects.)&nbsp;
<p>One <b>selects</b> objects by clicking on them with the mouse (left
button) or dragging a selection retangle over them (right mouse button
click inside the window and drag). The selection can be extended by holding
the shift-key. A number of manipulations can be applied either to a signle
object or to a selction of objects:
<p>Objects can be <b>deleted</b> by the delete-key or the cut functions.
The edit menu provides the usual functions for <b>cut</b>, <b>copy</b>
and <b>paste</b> with the usual short cuts.s
<p>Objects can be <b>moved</b> by clicking and dragging or using the arrow-keys
(speed up moving by holding the shift-key).
<p>Objects can be <b>resized</b> by clicking and dragging their right border
or using the plus-key "<b>+</b>" and minus-key "<b>-</b>" (speed up resizing
by holding the shift-key).
<p>A selection of objects can be <b>aligned</b> to the left, right, top,
and bottom most border.
<p>Additional manipulations can by applied to a single object via a contextual
pop-up menu (click right mouse button). The possible manipulations depend
on the type of the object.
<p>Note that there is <b>no</b> <b>undo</b> function implemented yet.
<p><a NAME="connections"></a>
<hr>
<h2>
Manipulating Connections</h2>
A connection between two objects can be established in edit mode between
the outlet of one object and the inlet of the other under the condition
that the inlet of the second object accepts the message or data emitted
by the connected outlet.&nbsp;
<p><b>Adding</b> a connection is done by clicking to its origin and then
to its target (outlet to inlet or inlet to outlet !). Alternatively a connection
can be dragged from the origin to the target (created when realeasing mouse
button). By holding the shift-key multiple targets can be connected to
the same origin (inlet or outlet !).
<p>A connection can be <b>selected</b> (by clicking on it) and <b>deleted</b>
with the cut edit function or the delete-key. The contextual pop-up menu
(click right mouse button) of an inlet or outlet allows to delete all its
connections.
<p><a NAME="text"></a>
<hr>
<h2>
Objects &amp; Text</h2>
When an object containing text (generic object, message, comment, ....)
is instantiated from the object palette or by pasting the text cursor is
immediately placed at the beginning of its text field and one can enter
or modify ist description. Clicking to an object containing text automatically
enters the text field. Editting an object is terminated by clicking outside
of its text field (to another object, elsewhere to the patcher window,
to another window).
<p>The object description typed to an object is automatically reformatted
by jMax. Only the <b>comment</b> object can contain text of an abitrary
formatting. Text can be <b>cut</b>, <b>copied</b> and <b>pasted</b> from
one object to another.
<p>The edit menu provides a "<b>Find</b>" function to search for symbols
in text objects. All objects containing a given symbol will be listed in
the find panel. By clicking to an entry of the object list, the window
of the objects patcher will be opened and the object will appear selected.
<p>An <b>invalid object</b> which can not be correctly instantiated because
of an invalid description or the current system setup appears grey. An
<b>error description</b> for each invalid object can be obtained by the
key short-cut <b>control-z</b>. The edit menu provides a "<b>Find Errors</b>"
function in order to obtain a list of invalid objects.
<p>Objects containing text have some special functions, which are accessible
via the text menu of the patcher window and the contextual pop-up menu
(click right mouse button) of the objects. This way <b>font</b>, <b>style</b>
and <b>size</b> can be adjusted for each object seperately.
<p>The function "<b>Fit to text</b>" in the Text menu of the patcher window
automatically adapts the object size to its description.
<p><a NAME="graphical contollers"></a>
<hr>
<h2>
Graphical Controllers</h2>
The graphical controller objects (<b>slider</b>, <b>button</b>, <b>toggle</b>,
...) are activated in lock mode. In edit mode the can be activated by holding
the control-key while manipulating or clicking them.
<p>Some graphical properties of the controllers con be set via a contextual
pop-up menu (click right mouse button) of the object. For example this
way one can change the color of a button or the range of a slider.
<p><a NAME="patcher"></a>
<hr>
<h2>
The Patcher Object</h2>
The patcher object can be used in order to group objects into a subpatcher
embedded in the patcher. A patcher object can behave like any other object,
it can have in- and outlets and can be parameterized by arguments.&nbsp;
<p>The first value typed to the patcher object (a symbol) is it's name.
Double clicking on the patcher object opens another patcher window where
the content of the patcher can be edited. Inlet&nbsp;<img SRC="tool_in.gif" BORDER=0 >
and outlet objects&nbsp;<img SRC="tool_out.gif" BORDER=0 > can be added
inside the patcher window each of them corresponding .to an inlet or outlet
of the patcher object.&nbsp;
<p>The inlets and outlets of a patcher are numbered, starting from 0. The
index correspond to the position of the inlet or outlet on the green patcher
object. A new inlet (or outlet) object instantiated gets the lowest index
which is not used yet by another inlet. Copying an inlet creates an inlet
with the same index. A patcher may contain several inlet objects (or outlet
objects) having same number. In this case, they receive the same data (in
undefined order) from the same connection connected to the patcher object.&nbsp;
<p>The index of an inlet (outlet) index can be changed via a pop-up menu
obtained by right-clicking on the object. The inlet (outlet) object with
the greatest index determines the number of inlets (outlets) of the patcher
(which is it's index plus one).&nbsp;
<p>(Note that the index of an inlet or outlet is a characteristic of this
object and <b>not</b> a function of the it's geometric position in the
patch like in ISPW Max)&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="help"></a>
<hr>
<h2>
Obtaining Help</h2>
Help information about an object in the patcher window can be obtained
by the clicking it <b>holding the alt-key</b> (or middle mouse button).
Help on a selection of objects (as for a single object) can be obtained
via the help menu (short-cut <b>control-h</b>).
<p>The help menu gives also access to the summary patches of the loaded
packages, examples and tutorials.
