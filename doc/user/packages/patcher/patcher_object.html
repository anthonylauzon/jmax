<H2>The Patcher Object</H2>

<P>The patcher object, which can be instantiated from the object palette
in the tool bar, can be used in order to group objects to a subpatcher
embedded in the patcher. A patcher object can behave like any other object,
it can have in- and outlets and can be parameterized by arguments. </P>

<P>The first value typed to the patcher object (a symbol) is it's name.
Double clicking on the patcher object opens another patcher window where
the content of the patcher can be edited. Inlets and outlets can be added
inside with the inlet and outlet object from the palette in the tool bar.
</P>

<P>The inlets and outlets of a patcher are numbered, starting from 0. The
index correspond to the position of the inlet or outlet on the patcher
object. A new inlet (outlet) object instantiated gets the lowest index
which is not used yet by another inlet (outlet). Copying an inlet (outlet)
creates an inlet (outlet) with the same index. </P>

<P>A patcher may contain several inlets (outlets) having same number. In
this case, they receive the same data (in undefined order) from the same
connection connected to the patcher object. </P>

<P>The index of an inlet (outlet) index can be changed via a pop-up menu
obtained by right-clicking on the object. The inlet (outlet) object with
the greatest index determines the number of inlets (outlets) of the patcher
(which is it's index plus one). </P>

<P>(Note that the index of an inlet or outlet is a characteristic of this
object and <B>not</B> a function of the it's geometric position in the
patch like in ISPW Max) </P>

<P>Please refer to the language section of this documentation for further
information about patchers, variables and templates. </P>
