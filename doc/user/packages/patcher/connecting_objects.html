<H2>Connecting Objects</H2>

<P>Connecting two objects can be done by clicking on an outlet (resp. an
inlet), then dragging or moving the mouse to an inlet (resp. outlet). The
connection is done when releasing (if dragging) or clicking (if moving)
on an inlet (resp. an outlet). </P>

<P><B>Note:</B> connection can be done from an outlet to an inlet (the
&quot;classical&quot; way) or from an inlet to an outlet. It can be done
by dragging or by clicking. </P>

<P><B>Multiple connections</B> can be done by clicking on an outlet (resp.
an inlet) with SHIFT_KEY pressed. Subsequent mouse clicks will be interpreted
this way: </P>

<UL>
<LI>SHIFT-clicking on an inlet (resp. an outlet) will do the connection
and leave the patch editor in connection mode (until the SHIFT_KEY is pressed).
You will connect the same object source and the same in/outlet with another
object, moving the mouse and clicking on another out/inlet</LI>

<LI>clicking on an inlet (resp. an outlet) will do the connection and return
the patch editor to its normal mode </LI>
</UL>

<P>Releasing the SHIFT_KEY during multiple connection will return the patch
to the normal mode.</P>

<P>To delete a connection you can select it and delete with Cut or with
the <TT>Delete</TT> key; you can delete all the connections starting or
ending to an inlet/outlet by typing <TT>Delete</TT> while the inlet/outlet
is highlighted. </P>
