<H2>Recovery Of Crashes</H2>

<P>There are a number of mechanism that try to help in critical situations
like crashes. </P>

<P>First of all, when <I>j</I>Max save a file, it first rename the original
file adding a <TT>.backup</TT> postfix to its name, and then generate the
new copy; this guarantee you to be able to backup to the state of last
save (be careful: the state of last save is not necessarily the initial
state of the editing session). </P>

<P>Also, in case of crashes of the DSP engine (<TT>fts</TT>), the system
will try to save all the loaded files and templates, in auto-save files,
whose name is generated by appending two '%' character to the original
file name; since these files are generated under a critical situation,
it is not guaranteed that their content is correct, but in many case they
can save the day; note that an unexpected crash can be generated by a bug
in the system <B>or</B> by a bug in an external object, for example during
its development. </P>

<P>In case of crashes of the Java Virtual Machine, it may happen that the
computational engine do not crash, and continue to run alone; in this case,
you may manually cause a crash in order to get the auto-save files. </P>

<P>In order to do this, you need to know the process id (<TT>pid</TT>)
of the running process called <TT>fts</TT>; you can find it out using the
Unix <TT>ps</TT> command; then, you may kill the process using the Unix
command <TT>kill</TT>; refer to the relative manual pages for details.
