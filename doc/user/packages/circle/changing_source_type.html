<H2>Changing Source Type</H2>

<P>You can toggle a source from <TT>Local Type</TT> to <TT>Receiver Type</TT>
and viceversa by CTRL-CLICK on it. When a source become a receiver, her
graphic representation changes (green with a white cross inside). When
you define a new receiver the old receiver become a local source. If you
are in &quot;<I><TT>relative to receiver representation mode&quot; </TT></I>the
representation changes relatively to new receiver. If there isn't a receiver
source, we are in absolute mode and the center of the sound scene is the
center of the background green cross.</P>
