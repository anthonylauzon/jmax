<H2>Recorder Tool</H2>

<P>With this tool you can record and playback a trajectory of a source
(or more sources) in the time, i.e. their changes in position , aperture
and orientation. The recording is done at a &quot;<B>sampling rate</B>&quot;
that you can change via the &quot;<B>Recorder Sampling Rate</B>&quot; menu
(submenu of the menu &quot;Options&quot;). The same for the playing.</P>

<P>When you mount this tool a set of buttons is shown at the top right
of the window. If you click on the &quot;<B>rec</B>&quot; button you can
start a recording session. When clicking on a source, the movements and
changes in aperture/orientation are recorded, and a trajectory is drawn
in the background with a node for every sample. The recording stops at
mouseUp. Now you can:</P>

<UL>
<LI>continue the recording with another (or the same) source by clicking
and moving</LI>

<LI>click on the &quot;<B>pause</B>&quot; button , then move a source without
recording the changes</LI>

<LI><A HREF="modify_trajectory.html">modify the trajectory</A> by selecting/removing/adding/modifying
the nodes of the trajectory</LI>

<LI>click on the &quot;<B>reset</B>&quot; button to delete the trajectory</LI>

<LI>click on the &quot;<B>ok</B>&quot; button to validate this trajectory
, exit from the record mode and activate the &quot;play&quot; button</LI>
</UL>

<P>When you click on the &quot;<B>play</B>&quot; button you start a thread
that play the trajectory with the current sampling rate and sends out the
corresponding messages.</P>

<P>At this point, click on the &quot;rec&quot; button to modify the existing
trajectory. Recording and playing are performed by different threads, so
you can play and record two different trajectory at the same time.</P>
