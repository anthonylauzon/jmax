<H2>What's a source?</H2>

<P>A source object is a symbolic and graphic representation for a sound
source in a sound scene. </P>

<P><B>Source Properties</B></P>

<UL>
<LI><B>identification number</B>: a unique id for the source in a Circle
instance, you can't change it</LI>

<LI><B>name</B>: a user name for the source, initialized by default to
the id number. The first char of it is drawn on the source. </LI>

<LI><B>color</B>: red by default. You can change it via the Source Inspector
Dialog</LI>

<LI><B>type</B>: if &quot;<TT>local&quot;, </TT>the source is a normal
sound object in the sound scene; if &quot;<TT>receiver&quot; , </TT>the
source represent the center of the sound scene and the auditory position.
In this case is not a sound producer</LI>

<LI><B>moving mode:</B> mode in which a moving source changes her orientation.
In &quot;<TT>centered mode</TT>&quot; the source is always oriented to
the center of the sound scene; in &quot;<TT>static mode</TT>&quot; the
source orientation don't change; in &quot;<TT>dynamic mode</TT>&quot; the
source orientation follow the moving direction</LI>

<LI>associated <B>spat-template</B>: is the .jmax template associated to
the source</LI>

<LI><B>presence</B>: proximity of sound source, energy of direct sound
and early room effect</LI>

<LI><B>warmth</B>: variation of early room effect relative to direct sound</LI>

<LI><B>brillance</B>: variation of early room effect relative to direct
sound</LI>

<LI><B>envelopment</B>: energy of early room effect relative to direct
sound</LI>

<LI><B>absolute cartesian and polar coordinates</B>: coordinates of the
source center relatively to the absolute center of the sound scene (the
center of the green cross in the background)</LI>

<LI><B>&quot;relative to receiver&quot; cartesian and polar coordinates</B>:
coordinates of the source center relatively to the center of the receiver
source with the y-axe according to the receiver orientation axe</LI>

<LI>absolute and relative to receiver <B>orientation: </B>direction of
the sound emission, misured relatively to the zero of cartesian axes</LI>

<LI><B>aperture: a</B>ngle of emission, misured relatively to the orientation</LI>
