<H2>Release Notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.3.12 </H2>

This is the release 2.3.12 of <i>j</i>Max.

<H3>Status</H3>

<P>
This release is qualified as <code>beta</code>; the system is quite stable,
enough to be used in concert situation; the user interface still has some
glitches and instability anyway.


<H3>Supported platform</H3>

<P>
This release have been compiled on:
<UL>
<LI> IRIX 6.5 for r10000 and r5000 processors.
<LI> IRIX 6.3 for r5000 processors.
</UL>

<P>
IRIX 6.2 will probably not be supported, as the AudioFile library
on IRIX 6.2 lacks some features used by jMax. We suggest that you
upgrade to IRIX 6.5.


<H3>Changes in I/O configuration</H3>

<P>
The I/O configuration commands have been simplified a little; 
old .jmaxrc files need to be changed; refer to the user configuration.


<H3>Changes in CLASSPATH setting</H3>

<P>
Swing classes are now distributed with <I>j</I>Max. It is no longer required
to download Swing. Setting CLASSPATH is also no longer needed.


<H3>Known Problems and bugs</H3>

<P>
Main problems regards the patch editor; in particular, overlapped objects
are not handled properly, and this produce bizarre situations when copy/pasting
in a crowded patch. 


<H3>Bug tracking system</H3>

<P>
Bugs are repertoried in the Ircam bug tracking system, at the following URL:
<A HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/Bugs/">http://www.ircam.fr/Bugs/</A> ; 
you will find there a list of known and fixed bugs, updated
on a daily base, and a bug report submission page that must be used for
bug report submission.
