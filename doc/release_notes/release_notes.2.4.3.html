<p>
This is release 2.4.3 of <i>j</i>Max.

<p>
This release introduces significant changes in the FTS kernel, in the user interface
and in the development API.


<h3>Status</h3>

<p>
This release is considered stable.


<h3>Supported platforms</h3>

<p>
The following platforms are supported:
<ul>
<li> Irix 6.3 for R5000 and R10000 processors
<li> Irix 6.5 for R4000, R5000 and R10000 processors
<li> Linux for Intel processors
</ul>


<h3> Fixed bugs </h3>

<p>
For a complete list of fixed and remaining bugs, please refer to the
Ircam bug tracking system, at the following URL:

<p>
Some stupid bugs have been replaced by newer ones.


<h3> New features </h3>


<h4> New patch editor </h4>

<p>
The patch editor of version 2.4.x is a new implementation of the existing patch
editor. It introduces bug fixes, improvements in the user interface (text handling,
feedback, updates, ...) and new functionalities (icons for objects
or comments, ...).

<p>
For a full documentation, refer to the 
<a href="../user/patcher.html">patch editor documentation</a>.


<h4> New multi-threaded kernel </h4>

<p>
The FTS server kernel is now multi-threaded. The kernel threads are for
now used only by the new implementation of the direct-to-disk objects. 
Others uses are in development.


<h4> New scheduler </h4>

<p>
The FTS server kernel incorporates a new scheduler that enables to add and remove
dynamically file descriptors in the scheduler's <code>select()</code> system call. 
This is illustrated in the <i>udp</i> and <i>udpmessage</i> objects that read bytes on a UDP port. 
See the sources of the object for further explanations.


<h4> Object development API </h4>

<p>
This release includes the object development API and documentation. Please refer
to the <a href="../developer/control_objects.html"><b>Control Objects Developer's Guide</b></a>
for documentation.

<p>
A package named "sources" with objects source code is given as an example and a starting point.


<h4> Direct-to-disk objects </h4>

<p>
The first use of the multi-threaded kernel
is a new implementation of the direct-to-disk objects (<i>readsf~</i> and <i>writesf~</i>). These
objects are now implemented as wrappers of an FTS device that does the file access,
all the file I/O being done in separate threads. This implementation guarantees that
file accesses are non-blocking and that file reading/writing and samples conversion
is done on a separate processor when running on a multi-processor machine.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> 
On the Linux platform, the direct-to-disk objects use the <i>Audio File Library</i>,
by Michael Pruett. This library is available under the GNU Library General Public
License. This library must be installed before using <i>readsf~</i> and
<i>writesf~</i> objects. Please refer to <a href="http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/">
