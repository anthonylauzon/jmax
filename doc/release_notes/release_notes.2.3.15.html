<CENTER> <H2> <I>j</I>Max 2.3.15 release notes </H2> </CENTER>

<P>
This is release 2.3.15 of <I>j</I>Max.

<H3>Status</H3>

<P>
This release is considered:
<UL>
<LI> <STRONG>stable</STRONG> on SGI
<LI> <STRONG>beta</STRONG> on Linux. Namely, the system has not
been extensively tested and its performance is not fully representative
of the final performance that can be achieved on Linux.
</UL>


<H3>Supported platforms</H3>

<p>
This release have been compiled on:
<ul>
<li> IRIX 6.5 for R10000, R5000, R4x00 processors
<li> IRIX 6.3 for R10000, R5000 processors
<LI> Linux for Intel Pentium-Pro and Pentium-II processors
</ul>

<h3>Fixed bugs</h3>

<p>
The following bugs have been fixed:
<ul>
<li> #154: systune maxlkmem must be checked
<li> #155: Pasting in a text field with already selected text
<li> (not reported): qlist jumps to top of text after paste
</ul>

<p>
This release implements a workaround for the following bug:
<ul>
<li> #139: printing in the console can freeze jmax. <BR>
By starting jMax either with the option "-jmaxNoConsole true"
or by adding the command "set jmaxNoConsole true" in your
.jmaxrc file, console printout will not show in the console 
window, but in the standard output of the java process, usually 
a shell, and will not freeze java. A new console graphic 
component will be implemented in a next release.
</ul>

<h3>Floating-point exceptions tracking</h3>

<p>
Support has been added to track floating-point exceptions.
When floating-point exceptions occur, you can open the
"Fpe Panel" in "Tools" menu. This panel will show the
objects that triggered these exceptions (either in control
or in DSP computation). A supplementary option allows
to track floating point NaN (Not a Number) in DSP computation.<BR>
<STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> This option is very time-consuming
and can dramatically decrease performance.


<h3>Bug tracking system</h3>

<P>
Bugs are repertoried in the Ircam bug tracking system, at the following URL:
<A HREF="http://www.ircam.fr/Bugs/">http://www.ircam.fr/Bugs/</A> ; 
you will find there a list of known and fixed bugs, updated
on a daily base, and a bug report submission page that must be used for
bug report submission.

<p>
In order to ease bug tracking and fixing, users are kindly required to use
the previously mentionned URL to report bugs.
