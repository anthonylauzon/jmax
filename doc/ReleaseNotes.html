<a NAME="2.5.1"><h1>Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.5.1</h1></a>

Please note that the release 2.5.1 was pre-released by Christian Klippel on his mamalala site.
Unfortunately there is no obvious distiction of these premature packages.
Anyway, THIS is jMax 2.5.1.

<h3>Java</h3>

<p>
<h3>Audio and MIDI configuration</h3>

After the classes alsaaudioport and ossaudioport for the audio configuration a class alsarawmidiport 
was introduced for the MIDI configuartion on the ALSA/Linux platform.

<p>
<h3>User interface</h3>

The DSP calculation can be switched on an of by the keyboard short cut Control/SpaceBar.

<p>
<h3>Object set</h3>

The classes "clock" and "at" of the ISPW packages where removed. 
It is no more possible to give a clock as first argument of the timing objects 
such as metro or delay as it was before.

The object "at dsp_msec 0", or "at dsp_tick 0", which is used in some patches in order 
to obtain a trigger at the instant of the DSP calculation being switched on must be 
replaced by an object "dsp" connected to an object "select 1" or "sel 1".

In the signal package the classes play~ and rec~ where add (see the help patches).

Two new objects have been introduced to the toolbar: 
an oscilloscope and an object to display numerical values or vectors of values in a scrolling display.

<p>
<h3>API</h3>
The API for FTS clocks 


<p>
<h3>Scheduling</h3>
The scheduling

<hr>
<a NAME="2.5.0"><h1>Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.5.0</h1></a>

<h3>Java 2</h3>

<p>
jMax is now fully Java 2 compliant: to run or compile it, you must use a Java 2
virtual machine (recommended are IBM, Sun or Blackdown JDK 1.3 or higher).

<h3>Makefiles</h3>

<p>
The Makefiles have changed in order to be simpler for developing objects.

<p>
A typical Makefile for a package is:
<p>
<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td>
<pre>
JMAXDISTDIR= ../../..
PACKAGEROOT = ..
MORESOLIBS=-lasound
PACKAGELIB=$(LIBDIR)/libalsa.so

include $(JMAXDISTDIR)/Makefiles/Makefile.package
</td></tr></table>
</pre>


<h3>Include files</h3>

<p>
The include files tree has been changed, in order to be able to compile a
package inside or outside the jMax source tree. Now, an object must do:
<pre>
#include &lt;fts/fts.h&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Audio and MIDI ports</h3>

<p>
Audio and MIDI I/O are now handled by "port" objects. These classes are documented
by their help patches that you can find in the summary of their respective packages
(oss, alsa, sgi, midi).

<p>
Corresponding Tcl commands have been added to set the default audio and MIDI port.
These commands are <tt>defaultAudio</tt> and <tt>defaultMidi</tt> and are documented
in <a href="configuration.html">Configuration documentation</a>.


<h3>Font appearance and rescaling of the patcher window</h3>
Since the available Java environments have different scalings for certain fonts, patches
created with former version of jMax or different environments might appear scrambled in 
the patcher window.
In order to reproduce the original appearance of the patchers on the used platform, 
jMax allows to set a scaling factor in the system setup (.jmaxrc) via TCL commands:

<blockquote><tt>setGraphicScaling &lt;x factor&gt; &lt;y factor&gt;</tt></blockquote>

<p>
The size of all patchers (position and size of the objects and the patcher windows) 
will be multiplied by the given factors. The scaling is applied to the graphical appearance
only and doesn't affect the actual parameters stored in the file.

<p>
The reference Java platform is the IBM 1.3. All system and help patches are created with
this environment. Please adjust the scaling factors for your platform until the help patches
appear correct on your system.

<p>
In order to adjust the appearance of older patches, jMax provides a rescaling functionality
which is accessible via the dialog "Rescale Window" in the "Edit" menu. The given factors
are applied to the current window. In this case the graphical parameters of all objects are
actually changed (and will be saved with the file).

<p>
(Note that the "Rescaling Window" function is applied in addition to the global scaling
factors given in the system setup.)


<h3>Control Panel</h3>

The control panel has been simplified and attached to the console window. Nevertheless
is can be detached from it by dragging the handle at its left border
out of the window. This way the control panel will appear as a
separate window. Closing the control panel window or dragging it back
to its original position will re-attach it to the console window.


<h3>Signal connections</h3>

All jMax signal object now accepts and adds multiple connections to their
inlets.  The output of the connected objects is added before being fed
to a given inlet.

<p>
Active signal connections (DSP on) are appearing as a zigzag line.

<p>
(Note that it was always possible to connect multiple signal outlets
to an inlet.  In former versions of jMax only one of multiple signal
output to the same inlet was taken into account.)


<h3>Labels</h3>

The set of basic classes of jMax has been modified and extended. 
In general you should have a look to the updated summary and help patches.

<p>
The inlet and outlet class has been merged with the functionalities of
the former send and receive objects.  Inlet and Receive as well as
outlet and send share the same graphical appearance.

<p>
The objects (see in the tool-bar) represent a new system feature called
"labels".  Numbered labels refer to the inlets and outlets of the
current patcher.  Named labels can be either undefined - in which
case they have a global scope - or defined. Labels are defined as
variables using the "label" class. The usual rules for variable scopes
(variables of a name starting with a capital letter are global) apply
as well to label.

<p>
(Note that the former send and receive are deprecated but for now work
exactly as the label classes.)

<p>
See the help summary of the system package.


<h3>Messages</h3>

The ISPW message box object (2nd in the object palette of the tool bar
in the patcher window) doesn't share the same syntax as the other objects
and will be hopefully soon replaced by a more powerful class.

<p>
In order to provide the possibility to express at least a single
message or constant (or list) using all syntactical possibilities of
jMax' constant expressions as the other objects (functions, variables,
symbol concatenation) a class was added to the palette (3rd
position). Please refer to its help patch.


<h3>Display</h3> 

A simple display class was added to jMax which can display any
message, various data and signals in text form. The object resizes
automatically in order to display its input as a single line of text.

<p>
Messages and control data are displayed with a limited rate
corresponding to a given display period (not yet variable). Signals
are displayed as their maximal absolute value over this period.


<h3>Busses</h3> 

This version of jMax implements busses for Messages and control data
as well as for signals. While connections via labels are static the
source as well as the target of a connection via an bus is variable
and can be changed at run time via an extra inlet of the throw or
catch object.

<p>
Please refer to the help patches of the objects bus (with throw and
catch) and bus~ (with throw~ and catch~).

(Note that signal busses systematically introduce a delay of one jMax
scheduler tick = <signal vector size> / <sample rate>, typically: 64 / 44100 = 1.49 msec.)


<h3>Signal Package</h3> 

The new signal package replaces successively the old ISPW signal
classes by a new set of classes. These classes use the variable
mechanism and reference data types (fvec) of jMax. The package is not
complete yet.

<p>
Please refer to the summary and help patches of the signal package.


<h3>Fonts</h3>

jMax' font sizes have from now on symbolic names (normal, small, large, ...).
It provides from now on two system fonts of variable and fixed size.

<p>
The rich set of platform dependent Java fonts and sizes stays
accessible via separate menus.

<p>
We hope this way to provide a better compatibility between different Java platforms
and releases.


<h3>Documentation updates</h3> 

Documentation has been updated to reflect changes.
See <a href="index.html">Documentation index</a> for further information and in 
particular the doc of the <a href="patcher.html">Console and Patcher Window</a>.


<h3>jMax tutorials</h3>

<p>
Thanks to Fabrice Medio and Norbert Schnell, a jMax tutorial is under development.
It is currently available via cvs:

<p>

<a NAME="2.4.14"><h1> Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.4.14 </h1></a>


<strong>
In this release, the MIDI objects are temporarily non-available on the Linux
platform, because of a re-implementation in progress.
</strong>


<h3>Features</h3>


<h4>Automatic selection of isolated processor (SGI platform)</h4>

<p>
On SGI platform, the default behavior is that FTS automatically runs on an isolated processor 
if there is one
processor that is isolated, thus taking advantage of multi-processors machines 
for better audio latency.

<p>
In order to be able to select by hand the processor on which FTS will run,
the option <code>--cpu=N</code> has been added to FTS, where N is the selected
processor numbered starting at 0. This option is only meaningful on SGI platform.

<p>
The jMax property <code>jmaxServerOptions</code> is used to pass options to 
FTS; this property can be set:
<ul>
<li> on the command line:<br>
<code>jmax -jmaxServerOptions --cpu=0</code>
<p>
<li> in the <code>.jmaxrc</code> file:<br>
<code>set jmaxServerOptions "--cpu=0"</code>
</ul>

<p>
To find what is an isolated processor and how to isolate a processor, check the
<i>mpadmin</i> man page. The better latency will be obtained when the processor
is both isolated and non-preemptive. Isolating a processor requires a
multi-processor system (Origin or Octane with 2 processors at least).


<h4>Re-implementation of the direct-to-disk objects (readsf~)</h4>

<p>
Because of problems on SGI platform related to bad interaction between threads
and isolated processor, the readsf~ has been re-implemented using a separate
server process for reading the sound files. 

<p>
The <code>readsf~</code> object now has an extra outlet that bangs when the
sound file is finished, allowing to play a file in loop or build a play list.

<p>
The readsf~ has a slightly different behavior as before: the <code>open</code>
message and the <code>play</code> message can be send in the same tick without
causing clicks and error messages. The <code>readsf~</code> object will start
playing the file as soon as the server process has opened the file and preloaded
the first blocks. This gives usually a delay that is below 20 milliseconds.
To get really a precise start time, a delay can be inserted between sending
the <code>open</code> message and the <code>play</code> message.

IRCAM's <a href="http://www.ircam.fr/bugs">bug tracking system</a>.



<h3>Features</h3>


<h4>Save in .pat format</h4>

<p>
For better MAX/MSP compatibility, jMax can now save in .pat format.
To use it, select "Save as" menu item, and in the file open box,
change "Format" to ".pat". 

<p>
<strong>Attention!!!</strong> This is first release of .pat save format.
It has not been fully debugged.


<h4>MIDI file reading</h4>

<p>
A MIDI file reading library has been added, based on the code of Tim Thompson.


<h4>Changes in kernel</h4>

<p>
The protocol is now binary in both directions, with a symbol cache on
each side of the connection.


<h4>ALSA devices</h4>

<p>
jMax now uses the 0.5.x version of ALSA.

<p>
A ALSA raw MIDI device has been added. It is named alsaMidi and requires
the package alsadev ("package require alsadev").


<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>
Thanks to Winfried Ritsch, the "serial" object is back (in the io package). It has been changed
to take advantage of the scheduler single select() call.

<p> 
There is a new graphical object in the tool-bar (called "fork"), which changes it's number of outlets 
when ones drags it on the right border. It repeats it's input from all outlets in right to left order
(replaces "trigger t t t t t ..." and "bangbang").

<h3>Notes</h3>

<h4>Building rpms or SGI packages</h4>

<p>
Building rpms and SGI packages is now moved to scripts in ./utils/rpm/buildrpm
and ./utils/sgi/buildpkg. These scripts are quite self explanatory.


<h4>New objects</h4>

<p>
A "for" object is new in the control package.

<p>
An object "vec" - a vector of generic values (atoms) - completes the first set in the data package.

<p>
In a new package called sequence lives an undocumented early beta version of a sequence object...


<h4>syspackages</h4>

<p>
Directory <code>syspackages/</code> has disappeared. All packages (including
devices) are now in <code>packages/</code>

<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is considered stable.
<h3>
Supported platforms</h3>
The following platforms are supported:
<ul>
<li>
Irix 6.3 for R5000 and R10000 processors</li>

<li>
Irix 6.5 for R4000, R5000 and R10000 processors</li>

<a href="http://www.ircam.fr/bugs/">http://www.ircam.fr/bugs/</a>
<p>Some older bugs have been replaced by newer ones, others have been kept.
<h3>
New features</h3>

<h4>
Patcher editor</h4>
The patch editor of version 2.4.x is a new implementation of the existing
patch editor. It introduces bug fixes, improvements in the user interface
(text handling, feedback, updates, ...) and new functionalities (icons
for objects or comments, ...).
<h4>
Multi-threaded kernel</h4>
The FTS server kernel is now multi-threaded. The kernel threads are for
now used only by the new implementation of the direct-to-disk objects.
Others uses are in development.
<h4>
Scheduler</h4>
The FTS server kernel incorporates a new scheduler that enables to add
and remove dynamically file descriptors in the scheduler's <tt>select()</tt>
system call. This is illustrated in the <i>udp</i> and <i>udpmessage</i>
objects that read bytes on a UDP port. See the sources of the object for
further explanations.
<h4>
Object development API</h4>
This release includes the object development API and documentation. Please
refer to the <i>Control Objects Developer's Guide</i> for documentation.
<p>A package named "sources" with objects source code is given as an example
and a starting point.
<h4>
Direct-to-disk objects</h4>
The first use of the multi-threaded kernel is a new implementation of the
direct-to-disk objects (<i>readsf~</i> and <i>writesf~</i>). These objects
are now implemented as wrappers of an FTS device that does the file access,
all the file I/O being done in separate threads. This implementation guarantees
that file accesses are non-blocking and that file reading/writing and samples
conversion is done on a separate processor when running on a multi-processor
machine.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> On the Linux platform, the direct-to-disk objects use the
<i>Audio
File Library</i>, by Michael Pruett. This library is available under the
GNU Library General Public License. This library must be installed before
using <i>readsf~</i> and
<i>writesf~</i> objects. Please refer to
<a href="http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/">http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/</a>

Linux for Intel Pentium-Pro and Pentium-II processors. jMax uses glibc
and has been tested on Redhat 5.1 and 5.2.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Fixed bugs</h3>
The following bugs have been fixed:
<ul>
<li>
#154: systune maxlkmem must be checked</li>

<li>
#155: Pasting in a text field with already selected text</li>

<li>
(not reported): qlist jumps to top of text after paste</li>
</ul>
This release implements a workaround for the following bug:
<ul>
<li>
#139: printing in the console can freeze jmax.</li>

<br>By starting jMax either with the option "-jmaxNoConsole true" or by
adding the command "set jmaxNoConsole true" in your .jmaxrc file, console
printout will not show in the console window, but in the standard output
of the java process, usually a shell, and will not freeze java. A new console
graphic component will be implemented in a next release.</ul>

<h4>
Floating-point exceptions tracking</h4>
Support has been added to track floating-point exceptions. When floating-point
exceptions occur, you can open the "Fpe Panel" in "Tools" menu. This panel
will show the objects that triggered these exceptions (either in control
or in DSP computation). A supplementary option allows to track floating
point NaN (Not a Number) in DSP computation.
<br><b>Warning:</b> This option is very time-consuming and can dramatically
decrease performance.

<h1>
Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.3.12</h1>

<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is qualified as <tt>beta</tt>; the system is quite stable,
enough to be used in concert situation; the user interface still has some
glitches and instability anyway.
<h3>
Supported platform</h3>
This release have been compiled on:
<ul>
<li>
IRIX 6.5 for r10000 and r5000 processors.</li>

<li>
IRIX 6.3 for r5000 processors.</li>
</ul>
IRIX 6.2 will probably not be supported, as the AudioFile library on IRIX
6.2 lacks some features used by jMax. We suggest that you upgrade to IRIX
6.5.
<h4>
Changes in I/O configuration</h4>
The I/O configuration commands have been simplified a little; old .jmaxrc
files need to be changed; refer to the user configuration.
<h4>
Changes in CLASSPATH setting</h4>
Swing classes are now distributed with <i>j</i>Max. It is no longer required
to download Swing. Setting CLASSPATH is also no longer needed.
<h3>
Known Problems and bugs</h3>
Main problems regards the patch editor; in particular, overlapped objects
are not handled properly, and this produce bizarre situations when copy/pasting
in a crowded patch.
