<a NAME="2.5.0"><h1>Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.5.0</h1></a>

<h3>Java 2</h3>

<p>
jMax is now fully Java 2 compliant: to run or compile it, you must use a Java 2
virtual machine (recommanded are IBM, Sun or Blackdown JDK 1.3 or higher).

<h3>Makefiles</h3>

<p>
The Makefiles have changed in order to be simpler for developping objects.

<p>
A typical Makefile for a package is:
<table border=1><tr><td>
<pre>
JMAXDISTDIR= ../../..
PACKAGEROOT = ..
MORESOLIBS=-lasound
PACKAGELIB=$(LIBDIR)/libalsa.so

include $(JMAXDISTDIR)/Makefiles/Makefile.package
</td></tr></table>
</pre>


<h3>Include files</h3>

<p>
The include files tree has been changed, in order to be able to compile a
package inside or outside the jMax source tree. Now, an object must do:
<pre>
#include &lt;fts/fts.h&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Audio and MIDI ports</h3>

<p>
Audio and MIDI I/O are now handled by "ports" objects. These objects are documented
by their help patches that you can find in the summary of their respective packages
(oss, alsa, sgi, midi).

<p>
Corresponding Tcl commands have been added to set the default audio and MIDI port.
These commands are <tt>defaultAudio</tt> and <tt>defaultMidi</tt> and are documented
in <a href="configuration.html">Configuration documentation</a>.

<strong>
In this release, the MIDI objects are temporarily non-available on the Linux
platform, because of a reimplementation in progress.
</strong>


<h3>Features</h3>


<h4>Automatic selection of isolated processor (SGI platform)</h4>

<p>
On SGI platform, the default behaviour is that FTS automatically runs on an isolated processor 
if there is one
processor that is isolated, thus taking advantage of multi-processors machines 
for better audio latency.

<p>
In order to be able to select by hand the processor on which FTS will run,
the option <code>--cpu=N</code> has been added to FTS, where N is the selected
processor numbered starting at 0. This option is only meaningfull on SGI platform.

<p>
The jMax property <code>jmaxServerOptions</code> is used to pass options to 
FTS; this property can be set:
<ul>
<li> on the command line:<br>
<code>jmax -jmaxServerOptions --cpu=0</code>
<p>
<li> in the <code>.jmaxrc</code> file:<br>
<code>set jmaxServerOptions "--cpu=0"</code>
</ul>

<p>
To find what is an isolated processor and how to isolate a processor, check the
<i>mpadmin</i> man page. The better latency will be obtained when the processor
is both isolated and non-preemptive. Isolating a processor requires a
multi-processor system (Origin or Octane with 2 processors at least).


<h4>Reimplementation of the direct-to-disk objects (readsf~)</h4>

<p>
Because of problems on SGI platform related to bad interaction between threads
and isolated processor, the readsf~ has been reimplemented using a separate
server process for reading the sound files. 

<p>
The <code>readsf~</code> object now has an extra outlet that bangs when the
sound file is finished, allowing to play a file in loop or build a play list.

<p>
The readsf~ has a slightly different behaviour as before: the <code>open</code>
message and the <code>play</code> message can be send in the same tick without
causing clicks and error messages. The <code>readsf~</code> object will start
playing the file as soon as the server process has opened the file and preloaded
the first blocks. This gives usually a delay that is below 20 milliseconds.
To get really a precise start time, a delay can be inserted between sending
the <code>open</code> message and the <code>play</code> message.

<a NAME="2.4.12">
 <h1> Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.4.12 </h1>
</a>

<h3>Platforms</h3>

<p>
The following platforms are supported:
<ul>
<li>Irix 6.5 for R5000 and R10000 processors</li>
<li>Linux for Intel processors</li>
<li>Linux for PowerPC</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bugs</h3>

<p>
The following bug was partially fixed:
<ul>
<li> incorrect handling of "local" host name for connexion, which resulted
in rsh problems, hostname setting and co...
</ul>

<p>
For a complete list of fixed and remaining bugs, please refer to the
IRCAM's <a href="http://www.ircam.fr/bugs">bug tracking system</a>.



<h3>Features</h3>


<h4>Save in .pat format</h4>

<p>
For better MAX/MSP compatibility, jMax can now save in .pat format.
To use it, select "Save as" menu item, and in the file open box,
change "Format" to ".pat". 

<p>
<strong>Attention!!!</strong> This is first release of .pat save format.
It has not been fully debugged.


<h4>MIDI file reading</h4>

<p>
A MIDI file reading library has been added, based on the code of Tim Thompson.


<h4>Changes in kernel</h4>

<p>
The protocol is now binary in both directions, with a symbol cache on
each side of the connection.


<h4>ALSA devices</h4>

<p>
jMax now uses the 0.5.x version of ALSA.

<p>
A ALSA raw MIDI device has been added. It is named alsaMidi and requires
the package alsadev ("package require alsadev").


<h4>Objects</h4>

<p>
Thanks to Winfried Ritsch, the "serial" object is back (in the io package). It has been changed
to take advantage of the scheduler single select() call.

<p> 
There is a new graphical object in the toolbar (called "fork"), which changes it's number of outlets 
when ones drags it on the right border. It repeats it's input from all outletss in right to left order
(replaces "trigger t t t t t ..." and "bangbang").

<h3>Notes</h3>

<h4>Building rpms or SGI packages</h4>

<p>
Building rpms and SGI packages is now moved to scripts in ./utils/rpm/buildrpm
and ./utils/sgi/buildpkg. These scripts are quite self explanatory.


<h4>New objects</h4>

<p>
A "for" object is new in the control package.

<p>
An object "vec" - a vector of generic values (atoms) - completes the first set in the data package.

<p>
In a new package called sequence lives an undocumented early beta version of a sequence object...


<h4>syspackages</h4>

<p>
Directory <code>syspackages/</code> has disappeared. All packages (including
devices) are now in <code>packages/</code>

For a complete list of fixed and remaining bugs, please refer to the
IRCAM's <a href="http://www.ircam.fr/bugs">bug tracking system</a>.

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>
The various Tcl <code>open</code> commands now accept arguments that
can be used to specify device parameters values. The affected commands are:
<ul>
<li> <code>openAudioIn</code>
<li> <code>openDefaultAudioIn</code>
<li> <code>openNamedDefaultAudioIn</code>
<li> <code>openAudioOut</code>

<p>
The parameters that are passed as the last argument (a list inside "")
are passed to the device <code>open</code> function. The arguments that
are accepted are device-dependent.

<p>
Example of use:
<pre>
openDefaultAudioIn stereoIn "device /dev/dsp8"
openDefaultAudioOut stereoOut "channels 8"
openDefaultMidi midi "device /dev/midi01"

</pre>


<p>
The Linux OSS MIDI device now accept a "mode" argument that is
passed to the <code>open()</code> system call in order to be able to
specify the file read/write mode of the device for device that
can be opened in only one direction. This argument can be passed
when opening the device with the <code>opendMidi</code> or
<code>openDefaultMidi</code> Tcl commands. This argument
can have the following value:
<ul>
<li> <code>r</code> for read-only
<li> <code>w</code> for write-only
<li> <code>rw</code> for read and write
</ul>

<a NAME="2.4.5">
 <h1> Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.4.5 </h1>
</a>

This release introduces significant changes in the FTS kernel, in the user
interface, in the development API and in the license...
<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is considered stable.
<h3>
Supported platforms</h3>
The following platforms are supported:
<ul>
<li>
Irix 6.3 for R5000 and R10000 processors</li>

<li>
Irix 6.5 for R4000, R5000 and R10000 processors</li>

<li>
Linux for Intel processors</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Fixed bugs</h3>
For a complete list of fixed and remaining bugs, please refer to the Ircam
bug tracking system, at the following URL:
<a href="http://www.ircam.fr/bugs/">http://www.ircam.fr/bugs/</a>
<p>Some older bugs have been replaced by newer ones, others have been kept.
<h3>
New features</h3>

<h4>
Patcher editor</h4>
The patch editor of version 2.4.x is a new implementation of the existing
patch editor. It introduces bug fixes, improvements in the user interface
(text handling, feedback, updates, ...) and new functionalities (icons
for objects or comments, ...).
<h4>
Multi-threaded kernel</h4>
The FTS server kernel is now multi-threaded. The kernel threads are for
now used only by the new implementation of the direct-to-disk objects.
Others uses are in development.
<h4>
Scheduler</h4>
The FTS server kernel incorporates a new scheduler that enables to add
and remove dynamically file descriptors in the scheduler's <tt>select()</tt>
system call. This is illustrated in the <i>udp</i> and <i>udpmessage</i>
objects that read bytes on a UDP port. See the sources of the object for
further explanations.
<h4>
Object development API</h4>
This release includes the object development API and documentation. Please
refer to the <i>Control Objects Developer's Guide</i> for documentation.
<p>A package named "sources" with objects source code is given as an example
and a starting point.
<h4>
Direct-to-disk objects</h4>
The first use of the multi-threaded kernel is a new implementation of the
direct-to-disk objects (<i>readsf~</i> and <i>writesf~</i>). These objects
are now implemented as wrappers of an FTS device that does the file access,
all the file I/O being done in separate threads. This implementation guarantees
that file accesses are non-blocking and that file reading/writing and samples
conversion is done on a separate processor when running on a multi-processor
machine.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> On the Linux platform, the direct-to-disk objects use the
<i>Audio
File Library</i>, by Michael Pruett. This library is available under the
GNU Library General Public License. This library must be installed before
using <i>readsf~</i> and
<i>writesf~</i> objects. Please refer to
<a href="http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/">http://www.68k.org./~michael/audiofile/</a>
for information and download.

<h1>
Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.3.15</h1>

<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is considered:
<ul>
<li>
<b>stable</b> on SGI</li>

<li>
<b>beta</b> on Linux. Namely, the system has not been extensively tested
and its performance is not fully representative of the final performance
that can be achieved on Linux.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Supported platforms</h3>
This release have been compiled on:
<ul>
<li>
IRIX 6.5 for R10000, R5000, R4x00 processors</li>

<li>
IRIX 6.3 for R10000, R5000 processors</li>

<li>
Linux for Intel Pentium-Pro and Pentium-II processors. jMax uses glibc
and has been tested on Redhat 5.1 and 5.2.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Fixed bugs</h3>
The following bugs have been fixed:
<ul>
<li>
#154: systune maxlkmem must be checked</li>

<li>
#155: Pasting in a text field with already selected text</li>

<li>
(not reported): qlist jumps to top of text after paste</li>
</ul>
This release implements a workaround for the following bug:
<ul>
<li>
#139: printing in the console can freeze jmax.</li>

<br>By starting jMax either with the option "-jmaxNoConsole true" or by
adding the command "set jmaxNoConsole true" in your .jmaxrc file, console
printout will not show in the console window, but in the standard output
of the java process, usually a shell, and will not freeze java. A new console
graphic component will be implemented in a next release.</ul>

<h4>
Floating-point exceptions tracking</h4>
Support has been added to track floating-point exceptions. When floating-point
exceptions occur, you can open the "Fpe Panel" in "Tools" menu. This panel
will show the objects that triggered these exceptions (either in control
or in DSP computation). A supplementary option allows to track floating
point NaN (Not a Number) in DSP computation.
<br><b>Warning:</b> This option is very time-consuming and can dramatically
decrease performance.

Release notes for <i>j</i>Max 2.3.12</h1>

<h3>
Status</h3>
This release is qualified as <tt>beta</tt>; the system is quite stable,
enough to be used in concert situation; the user interface still has some
glitches and instability anyway.
<h3>
Supported platform</h3>
This release have been compiled on:
<ul>
<li>
IRIX 6.5 for r10000 and r5000 processors.</li>

<li>
IRIX 6.3 for r5000 processors.</li>
</ul>
IRIX 6.2 will probably not be supported, as the AudioFile library on IRIX
6.2 lacks some features used by jMax. We suggest that you upgrade to IRIX
6.5.
<h4>
Changes in I/O configuration</h4>
The I/O configuration commands have been simplified a little; old .jmaxrc
files need to be changed; refer to the user configuration.
<h4>
Changes in CLASSPATH setting</h4>
Swing classes are now distributed with <i>j</i>Max. It is no longer required
to download Swing. Setting CLASSPATH is also no longer needed.
<h3>
Known Problems and bugs</h3>
Main problems regards the patch editor; in particular, overlapped objects
are not handled properly, and this produce bizarre situations when copy/pasting
in a crowded patch.
