<CENTER> <H1> jMax TODOs </H1> </CENTER>

<P>
This file centralizes information on what is to be done on jMax. It is more
a short term planning, where you are free to add your own TODOs. I will take
care of maintaining it in a state where it is usefull. <BR>

<H3> <A NAME="Patch editor"> Patch editor </A> </H3>


<H4> Look and feel </H4>

<P>
Try to fill object box with pale color.

<P> 
Use icons in object box (first use: patcher)

<P>
Selected color should be same for all.


<H4> UI </H4>

<P>
Reimplement connect by click (now only connect by drag).

<P>
Click then click too slow (implement old behaviour ? have a specific area for 
text editing ?)

<P>
Fix menu mess.

<P>
Add help menu...

<P>
Fix find panels.

<P>
Introduce color settings, settings panel and color chooser.


<H4> Graphic objects </H4>

<P>
Change slider to redraw handle only

<P>
Number boxes too big


<H4> Misc </H4>

<P>
When editing object, first edition (i.e. from palette or from empty object) sets the size of 
the object to its "relaxed" size (i.e. the minimal size that makes it one line). 
Following editions respects the size of the object


<H4> Implementation </H4>

<P>
Merge EditField and TextArea for editing.

<P>
Rewrite number box (GetVisibleString !!!)

<P>
Rewrite slider (slider + throttle...), in particular add a Paint_update() method
to paint only the throttle



<H3> <A NAME="Installation"> Installation </A> </H3>

<P>
When starting jmax without a -install, takes its basedirectory/../bin as root.

<P>
Do an installation on marimba (O2 R5k).



<H3> <A NAME="Release"> Release process </A> </H3>

<P>
Handle better RELEASE_NOTES (bugs, move file to save directory).

<P>
Fix script jmax-tar-distrib: make file name from release, check existence of tar file, copy the files,
change their mode absolutely

<P>
Fix jmax-make-release: do compile automatic, other stuff ??? (NB: jmax-make-release has never been used,
it is probably a good tentative, but too complex)



<H3> <A NAME="Beta-test"> Beta-test </A> </H3>

<P>
Remove swing and jacl from tar file

<P>
Add a brief documentation for installation (where to unpack, java, .jmaxrc)
